    "abstract": "Overhead work is known as one of the ergonomic risk factors that can lead to shoulder overload and injury. Anatomical alignment of rotator cuff muscles makes them the most vulnerable to injuries during overhead work. In this study, the effect of task rotation, as one of the administrative controls to reduce the risk of injury during overhead work, on the fatigue response of rotator cuff muscles was investigated. Twelve participants performed three submaximal exertions (5, 20, and 35% of maximum voluntary contraction (MVC)) using four task rotation sequences (increasing, decreasing, upward parabolic, and downward parabolic). Median frequency of surface electromyography (EMG), shoulder strength, and ratings of perceived exertion (RPE) were used to study the fatigue response of rotator cuff muscles. Although the average normalized muscle activity was similar in all sequences, the task rotation sequence had a significant effect on the median frequency. The effect of task rotation sequence on the strength and RPE was similar to that of the median frequency but was statistically not significant. The upward parabolic task rotation sequence resulted in the lowest fatigue among all the task sequences. Performing intense exertions apart from each other, warm-up exertions, and the presence of active recovery after the intense exertions could be the factors that produced the lowest fatigue during this sequence.",

    "abstract": "It has been shown that the type of stool influences lumbar posture and muscle activity during dental work. Studies investigating the effect on cervicothoracic muscle activity and posture are scarce though. The present study investigated the effect of different stool types on cervicothoracic muscle activity and posture during a dental procedure. Twenty five participants completed a simulated periodontal screening whilst sitting on the Ghopec, Salli MultiAdjuster saddle and A-dec dental stool. Muscle activity of M. Splenius Capitis, M. Sternocleidomastoideus, M. Trapezius Pars Descendens and M. Trapezius Pars Ascendens was measured using surface electromyography. Cervicothoracic posture was evaluated by means of a strain gauge (BodyGuard™) fixed between C5 and T2. No differences in muscle activity and posture were found between the three stools. Although the type of stool influences lumbar posture and muscle activity, it seems these differences are not continued at the cervicothoracic region.",

    "abstract": "Motor development was investigated in 114 children aged 4–9 years, and the effects of different cross-sectional shapes of chopsticks (octagonal, square, and triangular) on manipulation ability were examined. Children's chopstick manipulation was found to be related to the developmental stage and their way of holding them. Manipulation was enhanced when they transmitted the optimal force to the tips when closing, the bottom chopstick was stabilized when opening, and the upper chopstick was encouraged to rotate moderately. In addition, opening chopsticks is more difficult than closing them. Square chopsticks increase the force of the tips, whereas octagonal chopsticks encourage more rotation of the upper chopstick, indicating that differences in the ability to manipulate chopsticks during development affect the preference for cross-sectional shapes. We plan to examine the effectiveness of chopsticks with different cross-sectional shapes of the upper and bottom chopsticks by focusing on the opening operation.",

This research aimed to develop ergonomics slotting guidelines based upon the back and shoulder postures and electromyographic (EMG) responses of the deltoid and erector spinae muscles when individual items are picked from, or full cases replenished to, different shelf heights In the first study of two studies, participants lifted small items representative of piece-pick tasks from seven shelf heights. In the second study, participants performed a simulated full case replenishment task in which they lifted boxes weighing between 2.7 and 10.9 kg from a cart into a flow rack. Shelf height significantly affected all postural and EMG variables and there was a trade-off between back and shoulder muscle activity across the varying shelf heights. Together, these studies were used to develop some general ergonomic slotting guidelines that could be implemented to reduce biomechanical load exposures experienced by distribution center workers.",

    "doi": "10.1016/j.apergo.2021.103534",
    "abstract": "The continuing advancement of technology means that sociotechnical systems are primed for revolutionary changes to ways of working that can increase capability. It is critical to consider the unintended impact technology can have on human operators particularly regarding information flow and interactions within teams. Previous research revealed that the co-location of operator's dependent on each other for task relevant information can optimise information flow previously constrained by engineering considerations. The current work compared a novel circular configuration to that of a contemporary submarine control room. In the circular configuration, consoles faced inwards, permitting eye contact between operators, and three large screen displays were introduced to provide all operators with the same information. Ten teams participated in low and high demand dived tracking scenarios in a simulated submarine control room. All communications between operators were recorded in order to generate social, information, and task networks. These were statistically compared to networks generated from a baseline study of contemporary operation. Overall, the volume of verbal communications significantly reduced, information exchange was more structured, and the volume of tasks completed by operators significantly increased when operating in an inward facing circle configuration. The current work provides support for a data driven evidence-based approach to design that is information centric but endorsed by the end user to optimise performance and increase productivity. Implications of the work and future research ideas are discussed.",

    "abstract": "In the workplace, overconfidence is generally considered undesirable as it may increase people's propensity to take risks. In many areas (e.g., aviation, shipping, nuclear control, and driving), risk-taking is detrimental to safety. We hypothesised that decision-makers would be overconfident and, due to group polarisation, decision-making pairs would be more overconfident than single decision-makers. As was predicted, when answering a 24-item general knowledge questionnaire (d = 0.94) and a task exploring how they might reorient themselves if lost (d = 1.93), participants (N = 63) were overconfident about their performance; importantly, participants in pairs (n = 32) were more overconfident on general knowledge (Hedges' g = 0.51) and lost procedures (Hedges' g = 0.52), than were participants who completed the tasks alone (n = 31). The findings imply that in some situations, single decision-makers may exhibit less overconfidence. The safety implications for a number of areas are discussed.",

    "journal": "Applied Ergonomics",
    "year": "2021",
    "doi": "10.1016/j.apergo.2021.103536",
    "abstract": "Background Effective shooting performance relies heavily on sufficient grip strength. However, some standard issue pistols used by police services may have a trigger weight that causes problems for officers with insufficient grip strength, including female officers. The current study aimed to replicate previous findings, which show that grip strength is positively related to shooting performance. We also sought to determine what grip strength is required to achieve proficient scores on a standard police pistol qualification (PPQ) when a heavy trigger weight (i.e., 8lbs–12lbs) is used. Finally, we explored the relationship between officer gender and PPQ scores to determine if grip strength plays a mediating role in this relationship. Method The dominant hand grip strength (in lbs) of 86 male and 32 female officers were recorded prior to their participation in their agency mandated annual PPQ. Officer gender, grip strength, and PPQ scores were analyzed to explore how they related to one another. Results Grip strength significantly impacted officers’ ability to pass the PPQ, with female officers possessing lower grip strength compared to male officers, as well as achieving poorer scores on the PPQ. We determined that grip strengths in the range of 80lbs and 125lbs were needed to score approximately 85 % and 90 % on the PPQ, respectively; exceeding that of the average grip strength for the female officers in the study (M = 77.5lbs). Mediation analysis suggested that grip strength may mediate the relationship between officer gender and shooting performance, but studies with more power are needed to confirm that. Conclusion To improve shooting performance as well as public and police safety, law enforcement agencies may need to consider including grip strength training in their conditioning regime or examine the adoption pistols with a lighter trigger pull weight (e.g., 6lbs).",

    "doi": "10.1016/j.apergo.2021.103545",
    "abstract": "Exploring what types of app icons are attractive has been a topic of great interest in recent years. The main purpose of this study was to explore the neural mechanism of attention capturing of the anthropomorphic app icons based on neuroergonomics. Participants' perception of different app icons was investigated by using event-related potentials (ERPs) and attractiveness evaluation. The results showed that anthropomorphic app icons were evaluated more attractive and elicted larger P2, P3 and LPP amplitude than non-anthropomorphic app icons, which indicated an attention bias to attractive anthropomprphic app icons. The time course of the attention towards anthropomorphic app icons includes three main processes: an early stimulus-driven perceptual detection of app icon features (P2 during 160–200 ms), an involuntary allocation of attention to evaluate and categorize app icons (P3 during 300–500 ms), and experiencing different emotions to anthropomorphic versus non-anthropomorphic app icons (LPP during 500–800 ms). That is, the process of users’ perception and attention toward app icons combines “bottom-up” and “top-down” processes. Our findings suggest a new perspective to use ERP components (P2, P3, and LPP) to deep understanding of app icon design. A practical implication is that app icons could be designed using anthropomorphic elements to attract users.",

    "abstract": "This study investigates the effects of a dynamic seat pan design on sitting biomechanics, perceived pain and seat movement compared to a control. Thirty male participants were recruited for two experimental sessions consisting of a 2-h sitting exposure (standardized typing task). Spine angles, back muscle activity, perceived pain and calf circumference were measured pre and post exposure. Sitting in the dynamic condition resulted in lower pain ratings (p = 0.031), decreased calf circumference (p < 0.001), lower average seat pressure (p < 0.001), and greater seat contact area (p = 0.003) compared to the control. Spine angles and low back EMG for all 6 muscles showed no significant differences between chair conditions. These results suggest this dynamic seat pan design is effective at decreasing several negative components associated with sitting for the occupant. Future work should examine the longer-term effects of dynamic office chair features in the field setting with a more generalizable population.",

    "abstract": "Military exercises and recruit training requires soldiers, including new recruits, to undergo multiple days of substantial physical stress. The aim of this study was to evaluate the physiological impact of multiple days of military load carriage by addressing the hypothesis: A second day of load carriage increases oxygen uptake and reduces knee extensor torque compared to a single day of load carriage. A load carriage group (n = 12) (carrying 32 kg) and unloaded group (n = 14) walked on a treadmill for 2 h on two consecutive days. Knee extensor and flexor torque were assessed by dynamometry at speeds of: 0°·s−1,60°·s−1 and 180°·s−1 before and after load carriage on day one and two, and 24 h following day 2. Oxygen uptake was assessed via respiratory gas assessment at the 6th and 119th minute of load carriage on day one and two. When assessed by mixed methods ANOVA (alpha: 0.05), an interaction effect was observed for oxygen uptake (p < 0.001), with post hoc assessment highlighting second day of load carriage significantly increased oxygen uptake compared to day one post in the loaded group (28.9(3.0) vs 25.8(3.4), p = 0.048). An interaction effect was observed for all knee extensor variables (all p < 0.05). All knee extensor peak torque variables were significantly associated to oxygen uptake at 0°s−1 (r = −0.576, p < 0.05), 60°s−1 (r = −0.552, p < 0.05), and 180°s−1 (r = −0.589, p < 0.05). Two days of load carriage significantly increases oxygen uptake and reduces knee extensor and flexor torque compared to a single day of load carriage. Subsequently, physical training programmes aimed at increasing knee extensor strength may protect against increases in oxygen uptake.",

    "abstract": "The influence of a passive exoskeleton was assessed during repetitive lifting with different lifting styles (squat, stoop) and orientations (frontal/symmetric, lateral/asymmetric) on trunk and hip extensor muscle activity (primary outcomes), abdominal, leg, and shoulder muscle activity, joint kinematics, and heart rate (secondary outcomes). Using the exoskeleton significantly and partially clinically relevant reduced median/peak activity of the erector spinae (≤6%), biceps femoris (≤28%), rectus abdominis (≤6%) and increased median/peak activity of the vastus lateralis (≤69%), trapezius descendens (≤19%), and median knee (≤6%) and hip flexion angles (≤11%). Using the exoskeleton had only limited influence on muscular responses. The findings imply the exoskeleton particularly supports hip extension and requires an adjusted body posture during lifting with different styles and orientations. The potential of using exoskeletons for primary/secondary prevention of musculoskeletal disorders should be investigated in future research including a greater diversity of users in terms of age, gender, health status.",

    "abstract": "The delegation of tasks to a non-human agent in a sociotechnical system can extend human capabilities and performance. Effective performance is, however, reliant on a successful relationship between human operators and automation. Optronics is a partially automated system which has replaced periscope on board some modern submarine platforms, operating modes permit the completion of tasks either manually or utilizing automation. A reluctance to utilize automated functionality within the optronics system has been due to operator familiarity with legacy manual procedures based upon the use of a physical periscope. This highlights the gap that is prevalent between innovation, design, training and governance of automation utilization. The current work examined current (Control group) utilization of optronics technology using an expert population in a high fidelity simulator. Findings were utilized to guide the development of novel optronics specific standard operating procedures (Intervention group). Results indicate that automaton disuse was greatly reduced, which had had a positive overall impact on overall system performance with regard to productivity and accuracy. The current work highlights the importance of incorporating governance of use and training as part of an automation design and implementation program is critical to help ‘ maximize what you have’ .",

    "abstract": "Descriptions of resilient performance in healthcare services usually emphasize the role of skills and knowledge of caregivers. At the same time, the human factors discipline often frames digital technologies as sources of brittleness. This paper presents an exploratory investigation of the upside of ten digital technologies derived from Healthcare 4.0 (H4.0) in terms of their perceived contribution to six healthcare services and the four abilities of resilient healthcare: monitor, anticipate, respond, and learn. This contribution was assessed through a multinational survey conducted with 109 experts. Emergency rooms (ERs) and intensive care units (ICUs) stood out as the most benefited by H4.0 technologies. That is consistent with the high complexity of those services, which demand resilient performance. Four H4.0 technologies were top ranked regarding their impacts on the resilience of those services. They are further explored in follow-up interviews with ER and ICU professionals from hospitals in emerging and developed economies to collect examples of applications in their routines.",

    "abstract": "Smartphone hard key locations need to be ergonomically determined to improve grip stability and operational efficiency for users' convenience. The present study proposed an ergonomic design process that determines smartphone hard key locations by statistically analyzing the preferred hard key control areas of users with various hand sizes based on users’ preferred grip postures and hard key control areas. The proposed design process analyzes the characteristics of product design, user, task, and use context, the types of preferred grip posture, the preference distribution of grip posture, and the preference distribution of hard-key area, and then recommends the locations of hard keys by considering the preference distribution of hard-key area and design constraints. The proposed design process was applied to a smartphone with a 5-inch screen, resulting in 77–96 mm from the bottom of the device for a volume key to 20 mm on the left side and 88–97 mm for a power key to 10 mm on the right side. The proposed design process for the determination of smartphone hard-key locations would be of use to determine the locations of various portable product interfaces.",

    "abstract": "Falls during stair descent are dangerous and costly. Contrasting tread edge highlighters improve measures of stair safety, however the necessary contrast level of these interventions has not been investigated. Thirteen older adults (67.7 ± 5.5 years) completed stair descent trials under normal (300lx) and low (30lx) lighting conditions, blurred and normal vision, and four different contrast levels (0%, 30%, 50%, 70%) between the tread edge highlighter and the neighbouring tread surface. Cadence and heel clearance decreased for 0% contrast compared to 50% and 70% contrast conditions, but contrast had no effect on foot overhang. Blurred vision was observed to be a greater factor influencing biomechanical measures of fall risk than low ambient lighting. Results suggest higher contrast highlighters improve measures of safety, even more so during simulated vision impairment, and that at least 50% contrast difference provides adequate visual information for safer stair ambulation.",

    "abstract": "This study investigated the effects of target size and error rate on cognitive demand during augmented reality (AR) interactions. In a repeated-measures laboratory study, twenty participants performed two AR tasks (omni-directional pointing and cube placing) with different target sizes and error rates. During the AR tasks, we measured cerebral oxygenation using functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS), perceived workload using the NASA-TLX questionnaire, stress using the Short Stress State Questionnaire, and task performance (task completion time). The results showed that the AR tasks with more interaction errors increased cerebral oxygenation, perceived workload, and task completion time while the target size significantly affected physical demand and task completion time. These results suggest that appropriate target sizes and low system errors may reduce potential cognitive demand in AR interactions.",

    "abstract": "Hazard perception assessment may benefit from VR-presentation by removing field-of-view restrictions imposed by single-screen tests. One concern is whether VR-induced ‘cybersickness’ will offset any benefits. Self-reported cybersickness ratings were recorded from 77 participants viewing two variants of a 360-degree hazard test: hazard perception and hazard prediction. The latter was hypothesised to be particularly susceptible as clips abruptly cut to a probe question at hazard onset. Such sudden occlusions are thought to increase cybersickness. Overall cybersickness levels were low, with only four participants excluded for above-threshold sickness ratings. The remaining participants showed unexpectedly lower symptoms for the hazard prediction test and rated this test format as more comfortable and engaging. These findings mitigate concerns over the use of 360-degree videos in formative hazard assessments, even when clips involve sudden occlusions. Nonetheless, removal of any participants due to cybersickness raises problems for using VR for formal assessments of hazard perception skill.",

    "doi": "10.1016/j.apergo.2021.103526",
    "abstract": "In the phishing email literature, recent researchers have given much attention to individual differences in phishing susceptibility from the perspective of the Big Five personality traits. Although the effectiveness and advantages of the phishing susceptibility measures in the signal detection theory (SDT) framework have been verified, the cognitive mechanisms that lead to individual differences in these measures remain unknown. The current study proposed and examined a theoretical path model to explore how the Big Five personality traits, related knowledge and experience and the cognitive processing of emails (i.e., mail elaboration) influence users’ susceptibility to phishing emails. A sample of 414 Chinese participants completed the 44-item Big Five Personality Inventory (BFI-44), Mail Elaboration Scale (MES), Web Experience Questionnaire, Experience with Electronic Mail Scale, Knowledge and Technical Background Test and a demographic questionnaire. The phishing susceptibility measures were calculated after the participants finished an email legitimacy task in a role-playing scenario. The results showed that the general profile of the “victim personality” included low conscientiousness, low openness and high neuroticism, and Internet experience and computer and web knowledge played an important role. All of these factors have significant indirect effects on phishing susceptibility by influencing mail elaboration. Moreover, the probabilities of checking for further information or deleting the email reflect the sensitivity of email judgment. These findings reveal the mediating role of cognitive processing between individual factors and phishing susceptibility. The theoretical implications of this study for the phishing susceptibility literature and its applications to phishing risk interventions or training programs are discussed.",

Font styles/features are also known to affect reading eye movements (EM); however, few studies have examined these effects – and none used high-resolution displays. We examined the effects of font width on EMs by utilizing four fonts, from the Univers family, which varied in letter-width magnitude. Participants’ (n = 25) reading speed, saccade velocity, and the duration/number of fixations and saccades were recorded. The Ultra Condensed font significantly influenced readability and yielded: fewer fixations and saccades; longer fixation durations than the Roman and Extended fonts; and shorter saccade durations, relative to the other fonts. Readers efficiently adjusted their EMs such that no reading-speed differences were observed. The eye-tracking metrics revealed two trade-off effects: (1) fewer and shorter EMs and (2) more and longer EMs, which were revealed by the font-width manipulation.",

As working from home has become a common practice as a result of COVID-19, it is imperative to validate an appropriate self-report measure to assess sitting in this setting. This secondary analysis study aimed to validate the occupational sitting and physical activity questionnaire (OSPAQ) against an activPAL4™ in full-time home-based ‘office’ workers (n = 148; mean age = 44.90). Participants completed a modified version of the OSPAQ and wore an activPAL4™ for a full work week. The findings suggest that the modified OSPAQ has fair levels of validity in terms of correlation for sitting and standing (ρ = 0.35–0.43, all p < 0.05) and agreement (bias = 2–12%) at the group level; however, estimates were poor at an individual level, as suggested by wide limits of agreement (±22–30%). Overall, the OSPAQ showed to be an easily administered and valid questionnaire to measure group level sitting and standing in this sample of adults.",

    "abstract": "Laparoscopy is a cornerstone of modern surgical care, with clear advantages for the patients. However, it has also been associated with inducing upper body musculoskeletal disorders amongst surgeons due to their propensity to assume non-neutral postures. Further, there is a perception that patients with high body mass indexes (BMI) exacerbate these factors. Therefore, surgeon upper body postures were objectively quantified using inertial measurement units and the LUBA ergonomic framework was used to assess posture during laparoscopic training on patient models that simulated BMIs of 20, 30, 40 and 50 kg/m2. In all surgeons the posture of the upper body significantly worsened during simulated laparoscopic surgery on the BMI 50 kg/m2 model as compared to the baseline BMI model of 20 kg/m2. These findings suggest that performing laparoscopic surgery on patients with high BMIs increases the prevalence of non-neutral posture and may further increase the risk of musculoskeletal disorders in surgeons.",

    "abstract": "Practice guidelines can facilitate the translation of evidence-based knowledge into better occupational health and safety (OHS) prevention. This paper describes the development process, findings and content of a practice and evidence-based guideline for musculoskeletal pain (MSP) to OHS professionals in Denmark. We used a participatory process with involvement of more than 100 OHS professionals in the development of the guideline. The guideline contains three sections: 1) Rapid review of risk factors for MSP (Push/pull, Screen work, Lifting, Awkward postures and Psychosocial factors related to MSP) and single- and multi-stranded interventions targeting MSP. 2) Process recommendations for use of the guideline by a three-phase participatory process 3) Practical recommendations that contain advice and methods for the three-phase participatory process. This paper can promote future guideline development, as it provides specific insight into how OHS professionals can be included in the development of practice and evidence-based guideline through a participatory process.",

    "doi": "10.1016/j.apergo.2021.103518",
    "abstract": "The availability of keyboards with reduced key width has been recently promoted as an ergonomic aid for small-handed pianists to overcome any potential physical disadvantages that may restrict their piano repertoire. However, a lack of biomechanical data exists to support whether reduced piano key size is effective in achieving this outcome. This research investigates the effect of playing on three different key width size pianos (5.5-inch octave, 6.0-inch octave and conventional size with 6.5-inch octave) on hand, arm and shoulder muscle activity levels according to the hand size of the pianists. Results indicate that piano key size affects the muscle activity levels of selected muscles. Furthermore, this effect of different key sizes changed according to the players’ hand spans. Small-handed pianists may benefit from using smaller-sized keyboards to reduce muscular exertion during performance. This investigation provides preliminary EMG data supporting the use of different size keyboards to improve the ergonomic fit according to the dimensions of individual pianists.",

We propose a definition and conceptual model of health IT workflow integration. Using interviews of 12 emergency department (ED) physicians, we identify 134 excerpts of barriers and facilitators to workflow integration of a human factors (HF)-based clinical decision support (CDS) implemented in the ED. Using data on these 134 barriers and facilitators, we distinguish 25 components of workflow integration of the CDS, which are described according to four dimensions of workflow integration: time, flow, scope of patient journey, and level. The proposed definition and conceptual model of workflow integration can be used to inform health IT design; this is the purpose of the proposed checklist that can help to ensure consideration of workflow integration during the development of health IT.",

    "abstract": "Recent research has developed two eye-controlled highlighting techniques, namely, block highlight display (BHD) and single highlight display (SHD), that enhance information presentation based on a user's current gaze position. The present research aimed to investigate how these techniques facilitate mental processing of users' visual search in high information-density visual environments. In Experiment 1, 60 participants performed 3-, 6-, 9-, and 12-icon visual search tasks. The search times significantly increased as the number of icons increased with the SHD but not with the BHD. In Experiment 2, 40 participants performed a 49-icon visual search task. The search time was faster, and the fixation spatial density was lower with the BHD than with the SHD. These results suggested that the BHD supported parallel processing in the highlighted area and serial processing in the broader display area; thus, the BHD improved search performance compared to the SHD, which primarily supported serial processing.",

The CSWS algorithm was developed based on guidelines in the public domain for general vehicles and modified for firetrucks for their configuration and emergency driving. Twenty-four firefighters participated in the test in a driving simulator. The results show that the CSWS was effective in issuing preemptive warnings when the drivers were approaching curves with unsafe speed during emergency responses. Drivers reduced their driving speed at curve approaching and entering phases for most challenging curves, without affecting the overall time in completing the test route. Drivers had reduced number of severe braking and decreased average in-curve distance traveled over the safety speed limits, when the CSWS was in use. Drivers also rated the CSWS as assisting, effective and useful. In summary, the CSWS can enhance firetruck safety during emergency driving without sacrificing drivers’ precious response time.",

    "abstract": "The purpose of this study was to evaluate anthropometry and forearm muscle activity as predictors of maximal isometric wrist torque. Thirteen anthropometric measures, forearm electromyography from flexor carpi radialis (FCR) and extensor carpi radialis (ECR), and maximal isometric wrist flexion/extension torque were obtained from 25 male participants. Pearson correlation coefficients assessed relationships between peak isometric torque and: (1) anthropometrics, (2) FCR and ECR activation, (3) FCR/ECR antagonist/agonist coactivation ratios. Based on significant correlations, linear regression equations were developed (SPSS v.25; p < 0.05). Hand thickness, forearm circumference and ECR activation or hand thickness, elbow circumference, FCR activation and body weight were most highly correlated with extension or flexion torque, respectively. Hand thickness, forearm circumference, and ECR activation (R2 = 54.5%; p = 0.001) and hand thickness, elbow circumference, FCR activation (R2 = 68.3%; p < 0.001) explained similar variance in torque regressions as did the addition of body weight to extension (R2 = 58.0%; p = 0.001) and flexion (R2 = 69.9%; p < 0.001) torque regression equations, respectively. Circumference measurements, a pseudo for muscle size, and activation amplitude influenced wrist force output more than limb length or coactivation.",

    "abstract": "Slips, trips, and falls (STFs) are the second leading cause of non-fatal injuries and can lead to fatal incidents in the mining industry. Hazard identification is an essential first step in remediating STF hazards and creating a safer work environment. Previous research has identified industry-specific risk factors for STFs, evaluated exposures to those risk factors, and developed taxonomies of the hazards for the construction and farming sectors. In comparison, ErgoMine–a mobile device application-based ergonomics audit tool–is the only systematic evaluation tool that covers STF hazards in the mining industry. However, ErgoMine was not specifically developed to address STF hazards. This paper describes the development of a taxonomy that helps identify STF hazards at surface mining sites and provides recommendations to address these hazards to inform future evaluation tools. The objective was to develop a taxonomy that was self-explanatory, observable, repeatable, and solution oriented. In addition to current regulations, standards and guidelines were used to develop the taxonomy to ensure the focus was beyond basic compliance. A detailed description of how the STF hazard taxonomy was created for walkways, stairways, and fixed ladders is provided, along with two specific applications of its use. The STF hazard taxonomy can be used to develop tools like checklists and ergonomics audits to identify and remediate slip, trip, and fall hazards at surface mining facilities, thereby improving worker safety.",

    "abstract": "This study investigated repetitive patterns in the locations of touch errors as a function of the shapes and positions of soft buttons on a smartphone for two-thumb text entry. Forty-three right-handed college students with smartphone-use experience were recruited for testing. An experimental application was developed, and the locations and frequencies of touch errors were measured for the button combinations of seven shapes and eight positions. More than 70.0 % of touch errors occurred within 2 mm from the boundaries of the buttons. In terms of direction, touch errors were primarily observed below the buttons, across all the button shapes and positions. Simultaneously, touch errors often appeared on the lateral sides of the buttons: (1) close to the proximal phalange of the thumbs when the buttons were placed near the initial positions of the thumbs and (2) close to the initial positions of the thumbs when the buttons were placed near the top and bottom ends of the keyboard.",

    "abstract": "This study aims to investigate the effect of slider design and length on user performance and preference of smartphone versions of Visual Analogue Scale (VAS). Twenty-eight participants performed a task to set random target values with 8 smartphone versions of VAS: 2 slider designs (traditional design, modern design) × 4 slider lengths (4.3 cm, 5.8 cm, 10 cm landscape, 10 cm portrait). Experimental results showed that both slider design and length significantly affected the accuracy, task completion time and subject preference. Compared with the traditional slider design, the modern slider design showed significantly smaller bias in setting values, shorter task completion time, and higher subject preference. The slider length significantly affected all measures, and 5.8 cm was recommended due to small bias, short task completion time, dominant preference and excellent ability to closely fit the width of smartphone display with the portrait mode. These findings could provide mobile VAS and slider designers with useful references.",

Real-time biofeedback provided by a recently developed wearable device (PostureCoach) may be able to reduce this risk. The effectiveness of a two-day training intervention (including PostureCoach and an educational video) was evaluated for its ability to decrease the amount of time spent in end-range spine flexion. Twenty novice caregivers repeated a series of simulated care tasks. Real-time auditory biofeedback was provided to the intervention group (n = 10) when participants’ sagittal lumbar spine flexion exceeded a preset threshold during training trials. Participants in the control group (n = 10) received no feedback. Participants repeated the tasks again two weeks and two months post-intervention. The intervention group maintained decreased end-range (80th and 95th percentile) spine flexion compared to controls at both post-intervention time points.",

Hence it has been a profound area of research interest for several decades. However, hardly any detailed investigation has been undertaken to measure the pressure threshold in the head region. In this study, Pressure Discomfort Threshold (PDT) and Pressure Pain Threshold (PPT) were measured for two hundred eighteen healthy Chinese adults at seventy-six anatomical locations, and further statistical analyses were performed on the acquired data to understand the relationship between different demographic parameters. The results suggest that the pressure sensitivity is low in the vertex region, moderate in the forehead and temporal area, and high in the facial and nasal region. From this study, pressure sensitivity maps were developed for PDT and PPT for Chinese adults. The measured pressure threshold data showed no significant relationship with age and Body Mass Index (BMI).",

    "abstract": "The United States is facing an unprecedented epidemic of opioid addiction and death due to opioid overdose. In an effort to improve patient knowledge and safe use about opioids, an Electronic Medication Complete Communication (EMC2) opioid strategy was developed targeting opioid naïve patients in the Emergency Department (ED). We conducted pre and post sociotechnical systems analyses to evaluate the variance between the process before the intervention and whether or not the process changed as expected with the new intervention. Results were analyzed using thematic qualitative analysis. Sociotechnical systems modeling illustrates the complexity of designing interventions for emergency medicine that affect multiple patients, providers, work systems, technologies, and processes. The post work systems model illustrates that several elements in the external ED environment can affect the effectiveness of the intervention. Sociotechnical systems analysis is an effective tool to illustrate the opportunities for designing health system interventions and evaluating the fidelity of such interventions.",

    "abstract": "Worker posture, task time and performance are often affected when one-handed manual dexterous tasks are performed in small overhead spaces under an obscured view. A common method used for supplementing visual feedback in these cases is a hand-held telescopic mirror, but that involves working with both arms extended overhead, and is often accompanied by awkward neck and shoulder postures. A video camera was considered as an alternative to using a mirror for visual feedback and reducing overhead reach. A mirror, a borescope and an omnidirectional camera were evaluated while laboratory participants performed three one-handed simulated manufacturing tasks in a small overhead enclosure. Videos were recorded for quantifying the time that postures were assumed while performing the tasks. The average time that both arms were above mid-shoulder height for the omnidirectional camera was more than 2.5 times less than for the mirror and borescope. The average proportion of neck strain time was 0.01% (or less) for both the omnidirectional camera and the borescope, compared to 83.68% for the mirror. No significant differences were observed in task completion times between the three modalities. Hence, an omnidirectional camera can provide visibility while reducing straining postures for manufacturing operations involving overhead work.",

Transitions play a key role in facilitating the return to reality, which is of particular importance when the virtual world is far more agreeable than the real world. In the present study, the efficacy of a door transition − an almost “transparent” door falling out the top of the virtual environment and controlled by the user − was evaluated and compared to two basic transitions: a direct transition and a fading transition. Participants reported a strong preference for the door transition that was evaluated as being smoother, more controllable, and greatly facilitated the return to reality. Moreover, the results showed that the door transition triggered no greater sickness in participants than the two other types of transition.",

    "abstract": "Telemedicine implementation in ambulances can reduce time to treatment for stroke patients, which is important as “time is brain” for these patients. Limited research has explored the demands placed on acute stroke caregivers in a telemedicine-integrated ambulance system. This study investigates the impact of telemedicine on workload, teamwork, workflow, and communication of geographically distributed caregivers delivering stroke care in ambulance-based telemedicine and usability of the system. Simulated stroke sessions were conducted with 27 caregivers, who subsequently completed a survey measuring workload, usability, and teamwork. Follow-up interviews with each caregiver ascertained how telemedicine affected workflow and demands which were analyzed for barriers and facilitators to using telemedicine. Caregivers experienced moderate workload and rated team effectiveness and usability high. Barriers included frustration with equipment and with the training of caregivers increasing demands, the loss of personal connection of the neurologists with the patients, and physical constraints in the ambulance. Facilitators were more common with live visual communication increasing teamwork and efficiency, the ease of access to neurologist, increased flexibility, and high overall satisfaction and usability. Future research should focus on eliminating these barriers and supporting the distributed cognition of caregivers.",

    "abstract": "A systematic review was conducted to examine the effects of interventions aimed at reducing the negative consequences of interruptions on task performance. Medline, PsycINFO, PsycARTICLES, and the ABI/INFORM Collection were searched for relevant publications. Thirty-three laboratory-based experiments, containing 49 interventions, were reviewed. Seven types of interventions were identified. Overall, the use of interventions significantly increased primary task accuracy (standardized mean difference (SMD) = 1.03, P = 0.001) and reduced resumption lag (SMD = −0.51, P < 0.001), whereas no significant difference was observed for interrupting task accuracy. Subgroup analyses indicated that intervention effects varied by (i) the type of intervention and (ii) the type of primary task (procedural, decision-making, or problem-solving tasks). The narrative synthesis provided additional evidence regarding interruption lag and time spent on a primary task. In sum, this review identified the types of interventions that were particularly effective and provided implications for application and further investigation.",

    "abstract": "Globally, the walker is one of the most common assistive technologies used by older adults with mobility impairments, which is also the case in New Zealand. However, there is a scarcity of knowledge regarding their specific requirements in housing design. Adopting an ethnographic approach, the perceptions and spatial use of 16 older adults who used a walker were investigated as part of a larger study on quality of life and housing design. Five emergent themes for walker user perception and spatial use were identified, from which design considerations were distilled and then categorised into 10 design elements. The study highlights differences between the requirements for accommodating walkers and those for accommodating wheelchair users. It provides new insights into improved housing design for older adults, which have the potential to be incorporated into existing frameworks for accessible design and universal design thereby improving the independence and safety of older adults.",

    "abstract": "This study aimed to characterize the effects of walking with backpack load on upper limb function. Fifteen males participated in 3 conditions: no load, 40% body weight loaded backpack (BP) and loaded backpack with simulated rifle (BRC). Pinch strength, grip strength, sensory threshold, blood flow volume, and a manual dexterity test were assessed before and after a 45-min walking trial. Pinch strength in the BP condition was significantly different than the control (p < 0.05). Grooved pegboard times were faster after a seated recovery (p = 0.026) than immediately after walking with load. Blood flow was significantly decreased to <53% of baseline (p ≤ 0.001) in BP and BRC immediately after donning the backpack. No significant changes in grip strength or sensory threshold were measured among conditions or time points. In conclusion, pinch strength, manual dexterity and blood flow were affected by backpack carriage, but other upper limb measures remained unaffected.",

    "abstract": "To make graphical user interfaces look more fashionable, designers often make use of high-stroke-contrast fonts. We are yet to understand how these fonts affect reading. We examined the effect of letter-stroke contrast on three bold fonts, one with extreme contrast between thick and thin strokes, one with no contrast, and one in between. The fonts were designed for this experiment to enable control of font variables. Participants identified the middle letter in a lowercase letter trigram in each trial, briefly presented in the parafovea (at 2° left and right of fixation) and at the foveal fixation point. There was evidence for letter recognition impairment for the font with high stroke contrast compared to the fonts with low and medium stroke contrast, while there was no significant difference in performance between the medium- and low-stroke-contrast fonts. The results suggest that bold fonts with high stroke contrast should not be considered for designs where letter recognition is a priority.",

    "abstract": "The purpose of this study was to explore the potential of Kinect body joint detection to facilitate the calculation of energy expenditure during exergame exercises. Two Kinect-based biomechanical models - mechanical energy (KineticE) and work (WorkE) were employed to estimate the energy expenditure during four Wii™ exergame session. Consequently, two stepwise regression models were developed from nineteen participants’ data and then validated by five holdout participants. The data collected using an accelerometer (r = 0.835, p < 0.001) had the highest correlation as compared to that of the WorkE (r = 0.805, p < 0.001) and KineticE (r = 0.466, p < 0.001) correlations with the reference indirect calorimetry using Quark activity energy expenditure (QuarkAEE). The regression results show that KineticE and the weight of the participant were significant factors for mechanical energy prediction (AEEKinetic). However, according to the work prediction equation (AEEWork), only WorkE was significant. The new energy prediction models showed significant agreement with the standard QuarkAEE (AEEKinect, r = 0.641, p = 0.02; AEEWork, r = 0.793, p < 0.001), and they were comparable to accelerometer predictions (r = 0.682, p = 0.001). The findings indicate that Kinect can be a potentially viable alternative to measure energy expenditures. The models can be applied with higher accuracy, especially when the activity demands high body movements.",

    "abstract": "Metacarpal gloves are commonly used in heavy-duty industries such as mining and are typically thicker and bulkier than manufacturing or assembly industrial gloves. This pilot study investigates the impact of wearing metacarpal gloves on hand dexterity, functional capabilities, and perceived comfort. Four types of commercially available metacarpal gloves were selected for evaluation in a randomized controlled trial. Evaluations included turning and placing tests, also grip, pinch, and screwdriver tests, and rating of the perceived level of effort. Dexterity test results showed that metacarpal gloves significantly reduced the ability to perform motor tasks requiring coordination compared to bare hands. Hand functions such as gripping, pinching, and forearm rotations were not significantly affected. However, the perceived level of effort needed to complete those hand functions increased as the metacarpal glove's bulkiness increased. High levels of mechanical protection typically offered by metacarpal gloves can inversely affect hand dexterity and hand exertion.",

In this study, a systematic review was conducted of the literature regarding the use of AM in ergonomic-product design, and methodological aspects of the studies were analyzed. A literature search was performed using the keywords “3D print*,” “additive manufacturing,” “ergonomic*” and “human factors”. Included were studies reporting the use of AM specifically in ergonomic design of products/prototypes including the detailing of an ergonomic testing methodology used for evaluation. Forty studies were identified pertaining to the fields of medicine, assistive technology, wearable technology, hand tools, testing devices and others. The most commonly used technology was fused deposition modeling with polylactic acid, but the overall preferred material was acrylonitrile butadiene styrene. Various combinations of objective/subjective and qualitative/quantitative product evaluation methods were used. Based on the findings, recommendations were developed to facilitate the choice of most suitable AM technologies and materials for specific applications in ergonomics.",

    "abstract": "Industrial passive low-back exoskeletons have gained recent attention as ergonomic interventions to manual handling tasks. This research utilized a two-armed experimental approach (single vs dual-task paradigms) to quantify neural and biomechanical tradeoffs associated with short-term human-exoskeleton interaction (HEI) during asymmetrical lifting in twelve healthy adults balanced by gender. A dynamic, electromyography-assisted spine model was employed that indicated statistical, but marginal, biomechanical benefits of the tested exoskeleton, which diminished with the introduction of the cognitive dual-task. Using Near Infrared Spectroscopy (fNIRS)-based brain connectivity analyses, we found that the tested exoskeleton imposed greater neurocognitive and motor adaptation efforts by engaging action monitoring and error processing brain networks. Collectively, these findings indicate that a wearer's biomechanical response to increased cognitive demands in the workplace may offset the mechanical advantages of exoskeletons. We also demonstrate the utility of ambulatory fNIRS to capture the neural cost of HEI without the need for elaborate dual-task manipulations.",

    "abstract": "In this study, the relationship between gaze patterns, task duration, and years of experience, which are commonly used to define and evaluate expert surgeons in laparoscopic surgery, was identified. Ten surgeons with 1–28 years of experience and six inexperienced students were included. Subjects used forceps to repeat the task of suturing a suture pad. Each subject wore an eye-marking recorder, and gaze points were recorded and analyzed. No significant relationship between task duration and gaze pattern was observed. However, there was a significant relationship between a surgeon's years of experience and the percentage of time spent gazing at the forceps. Subjects with more years of experience operated without looking at the forceps and fixed their gaze on the operational target. Therefore, when analyzing laparoscopic gazing patterns, it may be more appropriate to define an “expert” based on the years of experience rather than task duration.",

We explored healthcare professionals' mental models of older adults’ transitions between the emergency department (ED) and skilled nursing facility (SNF). We conducted a thematic analysis of interviews with ED and SNF healthcare professionals and identified three themes: 1) ED and SNF healthcare professionals had misaligned mental models regarding communication processes and tools used during care transitions, 2) ED and SNF healthcare professionals had misaligned mental models regarding healthcare system capability, and 3) Misalignments led to individual and organizational consequences. Overall, we found that SNF and ED healthcare professionals are part of the same process but have different perceptions of the process. Future work must take steps to redesign and realign these distinct work systems such that those involved conceptualize themselves as part of a joint process.",

Results showed a strong curvilinear relationship where high TSA accuracy resulted in higher performance in some areas of air combat, measured with friendly losses and kills. There were diminishing returns in performance as TSA accuracy increased. This may explain why previous studies on air combat have found relatively weak relationships between situation awareness and performance where the relationship has been assumed to be linear.",

While ladders are often associated with fall-related injuries, other accident modes that do not result in a fall can be observed in real-world data. In this study, the available data from the National Electronic Injury Surveillance System database involving step ladder-related injuries was supplemented by a biomechanical consideration of kinematics and injury mechanism to further understand accident modes and injury patterns. Results of this study demonstrated that the most common accident mode was falling (91%), followed by non-fall errors in execution of intended kinematics (non-fall execution errors) (4%) and pinching (1%). Falls were commonly associated with fractures, non-fall execution errors were commonly associated with a strain or sprain, while pinches were commonly associated with lacerations. The results of this study show that during step ladder use in a non-occupational setting, the accident mode is associated with an injury pattern.",

While ladders are often associated with fall-related injuries, other accident modes that do not result in a fall can be observed in real-world data. In this study, the available data from the National Electronic Injury Surveillance System database involving step ladder-related injuries was supplemented by a biomechanical consideration of kinematics and injury mechanism to further understand accident modes and injury patterns. Results of this study demonstrated that the most common accident mode was falling (91%), followed by non-fall errors in execution of intended kinematics (non-fall execution errors) (4%) and pinching (1%). Falls were commonly associated with fractures, non-fall execution errors were commonly associated with a strain or sprain, while pinches were commonly associated with lacerations. The results of this study show that during step ladder use in a non-occupational setting, the accident mode is associated with an injury pattern.",

    "abstract": "Psychological flow is highly pleasurable, time-limited form of engagement in a task which has been shown to produce benefits in the workplace. Flow has historically been studied in the context of the interaction between the task and the performer. However, in work settings such as an office, many other factors may contribute to or hinder the achievement of flow. This present study broadens the research on flow to test the extent to which seating comfort while executing a challenging task influences an individual's ability to achieve flow. Fifty-four participants in this study were randomly assigned to one of two seat types and given a set of tasks to perform via a computer simulation. Seat comfort, coupled with participants' perceptions of their ability to concentrate on the simulation's set of tasks, was found to predict participants' flow experiences. Implications and future directions are discussed.",

    "abstract": "Scenario-based warnings for road safety can be provided in the environment of intelligent connected vehicles via Bluetooth earphones or smart wristbands; designing an optimal means of presentation to drivers is an important point of consideration. Vibration warnings have been widely studied owing to their unique benefits. This experimental study aims to identify suitable body parts for vibration warnings during driving. The independent variables were the vibration position (three levels of stimulus, i.e., wrist, shin, and upper jaw) and response effector (two levels, i.e., hand and foot). Experiment Tasks 1 and 2 measured participants’ simple reaction time and choice reaction time, respectively, when providing vibration warnings in non-driving situations. The results demonstrate that the vibration on the upper jaw has the shortest simple reaction time and choice reaction time. The effect of stimulus-response consistency on choice reaction time was insignificant. Task 3 was similar to Task 2, with the exception of simulated driving. Compared to the result in Task 2, the choice reaction time in Task 3 was approximately 200 ms longer. Vibration of the upper jaw was reported to have the highest perceived intensity and preference. Based on the study results, the design implications for wearable vibration warnings of collision avoidance systems are presented",

    "abstract": "This study aims to evaluate the effect of workstation type on the neural and vascular networks of the prefrontal cortex (PFC) underlying the cognitive activity involved during mental stress. Workstation design has been reported to affect the physical and mental health of employees. However, while the functional effects of ergonomic workstations have been documented, there is little research on the influence of workstation design on the executive function of the brain. In this study, 23 healthy volunteers in ergonomic and non-ergonomic workstations completed the Montreal imaging stress task, while their brain activity was recorded using the synchronized measurement of electroencephalography and functional near-infrared spectroscopy. The results revealed desynchronization in alpha rhythms and oxygenated hemoglobin, as well as decreased functional connectivity in the PFC networks at the non-ergonomic workstations. Additionally, a significant increase in salivary alpha-amylase activity was observed in all participants at the non-ergonomic workstations, confirming the presence of induced stress. These findings suggest that workstation design can significantly impact cognitive functioning and human capabilities at work. Therefore, the use of functional neuroimaging in workplace design can provide critical information on the causes of workplace-related stress.",

    "abstract": "A fieldwork study conducted in six units of a major metropolitan Australian hospital revealed that nurses' attitudes towards alarms are influenced by each unit's physical layout and caseload. Additionally, nurses relied heavily on both non-actionable and actionable alarms to maintain their awareness of the status of their patients' wellbeing, and used auditory alarms beyond the scope of their intended design. Results suggest that before reducing or removing auditory alarms from the clinical environment to improve patient safety, it is important to understand how nurses in different clinical contexts use current alarm systems to extract meaningful information. Such an understanding could guide appropriate alarm reduction strategies and guide alternative design solutions to support nurses' situation awareness during monitoring.",

    "doi": "10.1016/j.apergo.2021.103463",
    "abstract": "When designing objects, designers attempt to communicate the purpose and meaning of that object to users using various factors such as visual appearance (aesthetic), practical interaction elements (product semantics) and meanings beyond the practical product interaction (semiotics). This study sought to confirm the previous deductively-developed soma-semiotic framework, whose purpose was to understand and ultimately predict the emotional impact of different design elements on users, using one specifically designed object, Fruit Bowl (FB). The purpose of the study reported in this paper was to compare the theoretically derived emotional responses to FB from the soma-semiotic framework with empirically derived data from users in order to improve the framework. Sixty participants evaluated the meaning and emotion conveyed by FB as well as self-reported their own experienced emotions under two scenarios. The framework predicted that FB would convey joy in a first scenario, and amusement in a second scenario based on different movements. Using a weighted vector analysis based on Russell's two-dimensional Circumplex of emotions, users identified that the overall emotion of the first scenario to be similar to the predicted emotion. This was attributed mostly to the bouncy movement of the bowl and its visual aesthetic. However, in the second scenario the overall rating was calm/impressed; rather than humour. The abstract design did not favour users making the same associations as the designer. We recommend that the soma-semiotic framework be revised to include aesthetic, in addition to semiotic and semantic, elements as determinants of user interpretations and reactions to designed objects.",

    "abstract": "The number of studies on autonomous vehicles has increased over recent years. Many of these studies have indicated the importance of an external Human-Machine Interface of communication (eHMI) on autonomous vehicles to indicate their intentions to other road users. Using an experimental design, we compared three eHMIs coupled to three road infrastructures to observe pedestrians' crossing behavior and collect their feelings about different vehicle types. Our results showed that the eHMIs influence the pedestrians' decision to cross the street, confirming the importance of setting up eHMIs. The proportion of pedestrians who crossed in front of the autonomous vehicles was more significant for vehicles equipped with an eHMI than vehicles without an eHMI. In 10% of cases, pedestrians used circumvention strategies rather than crossing in front of a vehicle without an eHMI. This behavior was more often observed when there was no protected infrastructure. Finally, while our objective data failed to indicate whether a specific eHMI is better accepted than another, the subjective data on the participants' preferences provided some promising ideas for further studies and the eHMI final implementation.",

    "abstract": "This work examined the physical demands associated with 4 commercially available direct current right-angle power tools along with their computer controlled fastening strategies. Physical demands were measured via an external instrumented handle that could also control the trigger of each tool. Data revealed that forces recorded by the external handle for each of the 4 tools differed. Independent of Joint-Hardness and Target Torque the Atlas Copco TurboTight® and Cleco Low Torque Reaction fastening strategies, both using a rapid spindle-head rotation strategy, produced the lowest peak and impulse force, respectfully, when compared to the 2 tools that were designed to fasten with a longer duration. This work has shown that short duration fastening strategies provide an ergonomics benefit to the users as it requires less force to operate, such force reduction in previous research has been linked to reduced handle displacement and lower muscle effort.",

The objective of this experimental study was to examine the effects of horizontal and vertical hand loads on upper extremity muscle activity during concentric pushing and pulling exertions. Twenty young female participants conducted repetitive pushing and pulling trials with three horizontal loads (1 kg, 2 kg, 3 kg) and two vertical loads (0.6 kg, 1.3 kg) in a seated posture, while the myoelectric activity of seven upper extremity and shoulder muscles were quantified. Study results indicate that the shoulder flexor and extensor muscles were more strongly associated with horizontal load, and elbow flexors were more sensitive to vertical load. The empirical data from this systematic evaluation can offer initial insights for ergonomic design and evaluation of hand tools or occupational tasks that involve repetitive pushing or pulling.",

    "doi": "10.1016/j.apergo.2021.103462",
    "abstract": "Hand anthropometry is one of the fundamentals of ergonomic research and product design. Many studies have been conducted to analyze the hand dimensions among different populations, however, the definitions and the numbers of those dimensions were usually selected based on the experience of the researchers and the available equipment. Few studies explored the importance of each hand dimension regarding the 3D shape of the hand. In this paper, we aim to identify the dominant dimensions that influence the hand shape variability while considering the stability of the measurements in practice. A novel four-step research method was proposed where in the first step, based on literature study, we defined 58 landmarks and 53 dimensions for the exploration. In the second step, 80,000 virtual hand models, each had the associated 53 dimensions, were augmented by changing the weights of Principle Components (PCs) of a statistical shape model (SSM). Deep neural networks (DNNs) were used to establish the inverse relationships from the dimensions to the weight of each PC of the hand SSM. Using the structured sparsity learning method, we identified 21 dominant dimensions that represent 90% of the variance of the hand shape. In the third step, two different manual measuring methods were used to evaluate the stability of the measurements in practice. Finally, we selected 16 dominant dimensions with lower measurement variance by synthesizing the findings in Step 2 and 3. It was concluded that the recognized 21 dominant dimensions can be treated as the reference dimensions for anthropometric study and using the selected 16 dominant dimensions with lower measurement variance, ergonomists are able to generate a 3D hand model based on simple measurement tools with an accuracy of 5.9 mm. Though the accuracy is limited, the efforts are minimum, and the results can be used as an indicator in the early stage of research/design.",

    "abstract": "Auditory alarms offer great potential for facilitating human-computer interactions in complex, rapidly changing environments. They are particularly useful in medical settings, where in theory they should afford communication in emergency rooms, operating theatres, and hospitals around the world. Unfortunately, the sounds typically used in these devices are problematic, and researchers have documented numerous shortcomings. Their ubiquity means that even incremental improvements can have significant benefits for patient care. However, solutions have proven challenging for multiple reasons—including issues of backward compatibility inherent in changing any standard. Here we present a series of three experiments showing that manipulations to one specific, understudied property can significantly lower alarm annoyance without harming learning or memory—while preserving an alarm's melodic and rhythmic structure. These results suggest promising new directions for improving the hospital's soundscape, where evidence of problems related to sound are increasingly recognized as affecting medical outcomes as well as physician well-being.",

    "doi": "10.1016/j.apergo.2021.103476",
    "abstract": "This paper is aimed mainly at Human Factors and Ergonomics (HFE) practitioners. It addresses the sustainability of communities, since without them there is no real human future. It also fits current concerns about climate change and general sustainability. However, our understanding of the characteristics of sustainable communities is still insufficient, as is evidenced by the different perspectives extant in the HFE literature. This paper provides a further perspective based on systems ergonomics, intended both to extend our socio-technical understanding and to assist HFE practitioners in contributing to a broad approach by which to contribute to the never-ending renewal process for these communities. Without such an approach many communities will become unsustainable, with collapse as their end, as Tainter originally, icily, explained (Tainter 1988). The paper begins with a definition of a ‘sustainable community’, including its legal basis. Its sustainability goals are outlined, based mainly on principles of social justice, since without people there is no community. Then there is a discussion of the characteristics of sustainable communities, the classes of resources available to maintain sustainability, and some of the complexities and hindrances to this maintenance. The last sections link this conceptual landscape to HFE practice by outlining approaches and processes that move from the conceptual landscape in this paper to current practice.",

    "abstract": "While researchers have explored benefits of adding augmented reality graphics to vehicle displays, the impact of graphic characteristics have not been well researched. In this paper, we consider the impact of augmented reality graphic spatial location and motion, as well as turn direction, traffic presence, and gender, on participant driving and glance behavior and preferences. Twenty-two participants navigated through a simulated environment while using four different graphics. We employed a novel glance allocation analysis to differentiate information likely gathered with each glace with more granularity. Fixed graphics generally resulted in less visual attention and more time scanning for hazards than animated graphics. Finally, the screen-fixed graphic was preferred by participants over all world-relative graphics, suggesting that graphic spatially integration into the world may not always be necessary in visually complex urban environments like those considered in this study.",

A mixed-method design was used, where data from the obstetric sonographers and their immediate managers from 18 out of a Danish total of 20 obstetric departments was collected. The data was collected through a survey and interviews. 98.1% of the obstetric sonographers experienced ache, pain or discomfort related to scans. The most frequent cause for the sonographers' ergonomic challenges were the patients’ physique (93,52%) and the need to obtain good image quality (83,33%). These reasons are non-controllable parameters for the obstetric sonographers and requires a solution, which ergonomically supports the sonographers in these situations. All of the interviewed obstetric sonographers (n = 8) and immediate managers (n = 3) claimed they were interested in testing a solution based on robot-assisted ultrasound.",

This study aimed to evaluate an early prototype of a personalised home lighting system including body-worn loggers. A convenience sample (N = 28) wore the devices for 23 h in the field and were given a demonstration of the lighting system components. Participants reported on questionnaires their acceptance of the lighting system and experience of physical comfort and visual appearance of the body-worn loggers. Semi-structured interviews were also held. In a hierarchical linear regression, physical comfort of the loggers explained 35.8% of the variance of ‘the behavioural intention to use the system in the future’, and ‘performance expectancy’ explained 50.6%. The interview data helped understand the reasons for the physical and psychological discomfort of wearing the devices. Many participants reported they were not comfortable about using a mobile phone for presence detection in the home.",

However, whether video game types and game devices influence the training effects of video games remains controversial. This meta-analysis aimed to access and evaluate the effects of video game types and game devices in video game training on the cognition of older adults. Interestingly, results indicated that mouse/keyboard was superior over other video game devices on perceptual–motor function. The effect size (Hedge's g) for perceptual–motor function decreased by 1.777 and 1.722 when the video game training device changed from mouse/keyboard to driving simulator and motion controller. The effects of cognitive training game and conventional video game were moderated by session length. More well-designed studies are required to clarify the unique efficacy of video game types and devices for older adults with video game training.",

    "abstract": "The objective of this study was to provide a biomechanical comparison of two different types of active chairs (AC1 & AC2) versus a static chair (NAC). Thirty healthy participants were recruited: fifteen healthy females and fifteen healthy males. Participants worked at a computer workstation (1-h per chair). Equipment included: Pressure pads, Electromyography, Near–Infrared Spectroscopy, and Questionnaires (rate of perceived discomfort, seating discomfort questionnaire and exit survey). A significant increase in anterior–posterior postural sway was found on the seat pan with the use of the AC1. An increase in neuromuscular activity of the external obliques and an increase change in total oxygen index (%TOI) values in the gastrocnemius were also found using the AC1, however the difference was not much higher than the NAC and AC2. Lower discomfort scores in the gluteal area were found with the use of active chair AC1 compared to the NAC. Preliminary findings suggest that having an office chair with a split seat pan design shows potential to yield biomechanical and physiological benefits for the sitter, however further research is needed to better understand the ergonomic benefits of active sitting.",

    "doi": "10.1016/j.apergo.2021.103486",
    "abstract": "This research empirically evaluates the introduction of speech to existing keyboard and mouse input modalities in an application used to control aircraft in a simulated, complex and dynamic environment. Task performance and task performance degradation are assessed for three levels of workload. Previous studies have evaluated task performance using these modalities however, only a couple have evaluated task performance under varying workload. Even though speech is a common addition to modern control interfaces, the effect of varying workload on this combination of control modalities has not yet been reported. Thirty-six participants commanded simulated aircraft through generated obstacle courses to reach a Combat Air Patrol (CAP) point while also responding to a secondary task. There were nine conditions that varied the control modality (Keyboard and Mouse (KM), Voice (V), and Keyboard, Mouse and Voice (KMV)), and workload by varying the number of aircraft being controlled (low, medium and high). Results showed that KM outperformed KMV and V for the low and medium workload levels. However, task performance with KMV was found to degrade the least as workload increased. KMV and KM were found to enable significantly more correct responses to the secondary task which was delivered aurally. Participants reported a preference for the combined modalities (KMV), self-assessing that KMV most reduced their workload. This research suggests that the addition of a speech interface to existing keyboard and mouse modalities, for control of aircraft in a simulation, may help manage cognitive load and may assist in controlling more aircraft under higher workloads.",

    "abstract": "Recently, motion-based navigation interfaces have been widely utilized in virtual reality (VR) environments. However, improper navigation interfaces can negatively impact the VR experience, and because different interfaces have different characteristics, the navigation experience may vary. Although comparative studies have been conducted with various interfaces, information obtained by focusing on qualitative evaluation was limited. Thus, this study explores the effects from three navigation interfaces (walking-in-place (WIP), joystick, and teleportation) on user performance, sense of presence, workload, usability, and motion sickness through a mixed-method design. Twenty-one participants were asked to perform a navigation task using selected navigation interfaces. The results indicated different advantages and disadvantages in the navigation interfaces for each evaluation metric. In particular, it was found that more research on user safety is required for the WIP interface. The findings of this study are expected to contribute to the development of guidelines for applying navigation interfaces to specific VR environments.",

    "journal": "Applied Ergonomics",
    "year": "2021",
    "doi": "10.1016/j.apergo.2021.103483",
    "abstract": "Work-Related Musculoskeletal Disorders of the Upper Limbs (WRMSDs-ULs) are one of the most common occupational diseases worldwide. Repetitive motion is one of the main risk factors associated with these conditions. Several efforts have been made within the scientific community in order to develop specific methods to assess the risk that repetitive work represents. Furthermore, internationally coordinated work has resulted in the generation of a series of ISO standards to address issues around ergonomics in the workplace. In 2012, Chile adopted the ISO11228-3 standard checklist in its regulatory process, creating the first technical standard of risk management for repetitive motion. The aim of this study is to present the results of a nation-wide online survey of Chilean Health and Safety Practitioners and Ergonomists, which was conducted in order to identify their level of application experience, most commonly adopted practices, and opinions on the first Chilean Standard for WRMSDs-ULs risk assessment. A second aim is to discuss common issues and possible improvements in public policies, and the adoption of international instruments by developing countries. A total of 331 respondents completed the survey (183 Ergonomists and 148 non-ergonomist). It was observed that a number of the participants consider that the adaptation of the ISO standard has several issues, ranging from simple ones as wording and format to more complex ones regarding overall structure, logic, and ease of use. One of the main issues expressed is the fact that during the adaptation process the instrument is applied in multitask jobs, without providing clear instructions or training. Furthermore, among the top three most used assessment methods were RULA and REBA, which are posture-driven, instead of methods validated for repetitive motion. The issues detected by the Chilean OHS practitioners are common in developing countries, where an intersection of lack of resources, public agency authoritarianism, and poor communication between public-private and public-public organizations contribute to poor consultation, validation, and adaptation processes. Suggestions to improve the current Chilean standard, as well as considerations for developing countries, are presented.",

A counterbalanced, within-subjects design was used with four simulated driving conditions: PSel fast-tempo music, PSel slow-tempo music, RSel music and an urban traffic-noise control. The between-subjects variable of personality (introverts vs. extroverts) was explored. The presence of PSel slow-tempo music and RSel music optimised affective valence and arousal for urban driving. NASA Task Load Index scores indicated that the urban traffic-noise control increased mental demand compared to PSel slow-tempo music. In the PSel slow-tempo condition, less use was made of the brake pedal. When compared to extroverts, introverts recorded lower mean speed and attracted lower risk ratings under PSel slow-tempo music. The utility of PSel slow-tempo and RSel music was demonstrated in terms of optimising affective state for simulated urban driving.",

    "abstract": "The Certified Nursing Assistant (CNA) is an important part of the workforce in hospitals and nursing homes, whose work includes heavy and repetitive work tasks including patient manual handling. The Structured Multidisciplinary work Evaluation Tool (SMET) questionnaire is an Occupational Health Service method for evaluation of the work environment. The aim of this study is to compare the SMET questionnaire with technical measurements of physical workload in CNAs in a medical ward setting. 16 CNA's participated voluntarily to 8 h of measurements during one workday. Physical workload was measured with surface electromyography and inclinometers, and the work environment was evaluated with the SMET questionnaire during the same working day. Spearman's rho was used in the statistical correlation analysis between measurements. This study shows strong, statistically significant correlations between the items in the SMET questionnaire and measured physical workload, n CNAs.",

    "abstract": "Aim To determine how anthropometric characteristics cluster in the New Zealand Defence Force, and to describe the characteristics of each cluster. This information can inform the development of new uniform sizing systems for the New Zealand Defence Force. Methods Anthropometric data (n = 84 variables) from 1,003 participants (212 females; 791 males) in the New Zealand Defence Force Anthropometry Survey (NZDFAS) were used. The dataset was stratified by gender and variables isolated based on their relevance to shirt and trouser sizing. Principal Component Analysis was used to identify the most important variables for clustering. A combination of two-step and k-means clustering was used to derive cluster characteristics. Results The PCA identified optimal clothing (shirt = body height and waist girth; and trouser = inseam length and hip girth for females; inseam length and waist girth for males) variables. Two-step and k-means clustering identified optimal cluster numbers of 6 and 10 for female and male clothing, respectively. The female clothing clusters were more variable (intra-cluster) and further apart (inter-cluster) compared to males. Conclusions Anthropometric measurements in combination with clustering techniques show promise for partitioning individuals into distinct groups. The anthropometry dimensions associated with each cluster can be used by the garment industry to develop specific sizing systems for the New Zealand Defence Force population.",

    "abstract": "Musculoskeletal models may enhance our understanding of the dynamic loading of the joints during manual material handling. This study used state-of-the-art musculoskeletal models to determine the effects of load mass, asymmetry angle, horizontal location and deposit height on the dynamic loading of the knees, shoulders and lumbar spine during lifting. Recommended weight limits and lifting indices were also calculated using the NIOSH lifting equation. Based on 1832 lifts from 22 subjects, we found that load mass had the most substantial effect on L5-S1 compression. Increments in asymmetry led to large increases in mediolateral shear, while load mass and asymmetry had significant effects on anteroposterior shear. Increased deposit height led to higher shoulder forces, while the horizontal location mostly affected the forces in the knees and shoulders. These results generally support the findings of previous research, but notable differences in the trends and magnitudes of the estimated forces were observed.",

    "abstract": "Human movement is characterized by its variability: the same task is never performed twice in exactly the same way. This variability is believed to play a functional role in movement performance and adaptability, as well as in preventing musculoskeletal damage. This article focuses on the time-evolution of movement variability throughout a repetitive pointing task until exhaustion. The kinematics of 13 subjects performing the pointing task is analyzed. Principal Component Analysis of joint angles identifies joint coordinations for each pointing cycle, and cycle-by-cycle comparison highlights movement variability. Non-supervised clustering reveals that subjects adopt successive coordination patterns at an intra-individual level. Inter-individual variability is characterized by the number and type of such patterns: from 3 to 5 patterns, mobilizing the trunk, the shoulder and the upper limbs differently. Movement variability exists even in a seemingly basic and constrained task. It appears in the very early stages of fatigue onset, and may correspond to adaptative coordination responses throughout task performance. This observation should encourage workstation designers to better account for movement variability in order to preserve operators' health and safety.",

    "abstract": "Purpose Nonlinear analysis techniques provide a powerful approach to explore dynamics of posture-related time-varying signals. The aim of this study was to investigate the fundamental interactions between postural variability structure and discomfort development during prolonged standing. Methods Twenty participants, with equal distribution for gender and standing work experience (SWE), completed a simulated long-term standing test. Low back and legs discomfort, center of pressure, lumbar curvature, and EMG activity of trunk and leg muscles were monitored. Nonlinear measures including largest lyapunov exponent, multi-scale entropy, and detrended fluctuation analysis were applied to characterize the variability structure (i.e., complexity) in each signal. The size (i.e., amount) of variability was also computed using traditional linear metrics. Results With progress of low back and legs discomfort over standing periods, significant lower levels were perceived by the participants having SWE. The amount of variability in all signals (except external oblique EMG activity) were significantly increased with the time progress for all participants. The structure of variability in most signals demonstrated a lower complexity (more regularity) with fractal properties that deviated from 1/f noise. The SWE group showed a higher complexity levels. Conclusions Overall, the findings verified variations in structure and amount of the postural variability. However, nonlinear analysis identified postural strategies according to the perceived discomfort in a different way. These results provide supports for future application of nonlinear tools in evaluating standing tasks and related ergonomics interventions as it allows further insight into how discomfort development impact the structure of postural changes.",

    "abstract": "In hand-held human machine systems the biodynamic response of the human hand arm system influences the overall dynamic behavior. The biodynamic response of the hand arm system is affected by several influencing factors. These influencing factors include the feed force, body posture, gripping force, and anthropometric properties. In present studies the importance of the gripping force on the biodynamic response is highlighted. In the state of the art; however, the magnitude of gripping forces as well as the influence of the human factors body posture and feed force on hammer drills for a larger group of professional users is unclear. To analyze the influence that these human factors have on hammer drill vibrations, a study with 15 professional power tool test personnel has been conducted. Characteristic gripping force values have been measured (Median: 84 N–156 N at the main handle, 10 N–30 N on the auxiliary handle) for different feed forces (100 N, 150 N, 200 N) and body postures. Then the influence of body posture, feed force, and gripping force on the hammer drill vibration is determined. A significant influence of the body posture (ANOVA: p = .003, r = .367) on the RMS acceleration of the main handle was observed. Furthermore, the feed force has a significant influence on the vibration of the hammer-drill for some groups. The data also demonstrates that for increasing gripping forces, the RMS of the acceleration and frequency weighted acceleration a h v on the main and auxiliary handle decrease. The findings of this study represent a starting point for the development of adjustable hand-arm models for the reproducible vibration assessment of power tools.",

The study identified and reviewed the findings of 24 systematic reviews or meta-analysis and 6 longitudinal studies. Publications were systematically searched in several databases from 1966 to January 2021. To summarize the level of evidence, a best evidence synthesis was performed, and the quality of included studies was rated. High job demands, high job strain, high effort/reward-imbalance and low social support showed a strong evidence to increase the risk for musculoskeletal disorders. In addition to job demands and job strain, low perceived fairness proved to be a risk factor of absenteeism with strong evidence. Due to the small number of studies, no reliable evidence assessment for workplace accidents was possible. The summarized findings can improve risk assessment methods, by providing a systematic estimation of the potential risk severity of psychosocial work characteristics and assist practitioners in further developing the psychosocial risk assessment.",

Cardiovascular and psychological stress were recorded throughout the interventions. During the alarm signal, HR reactivity was greater in NightSA than in DaySA (p < 0.01). Parasympathetic reactivation and self-confidence were significantly lower in NightSA than in DaySA (p < 0.05). HR reactivity was decreased in NightVA in comparison to NightSA (p < 0.05). Overall, the rescue intervention had a greater impact on the psychophysiological variables during the night than during the day, and the type of alarm had a minor effect.",

    "abstract": "An important question in the development of automated vehicles (AVs) is which driving style AVs should adopt and how other road users perceive them. The current study aimed to determine which AV behaviours contribute to pedestrians' judgements as to whether the vehicle is driving manually or automatically as well as judgements of likeability. We tested five target trajectories of an AV in curves: playback manual driving, two stereotypical automated driving conditions (road centre tendency, lane centre tendency), and two stereotypical manual driving conditions, which slowed down for curves and cut curves. In addition, four braking patterns for approaching a zebra crossing were tested: manual braking, stereotypical automated driving (fixed deceleration), and two variations of stereotypical manual driving (sudden stop, crawling forward). The AV was observed by 24 participants standing on the curb of the road in groups. After each passing of the AV, participants rated whether the car was driven manually or automatically, and the degree to which they liked the AV's behaviour. Results showed that the playback manual trajectory was considered more manual than the other trajectory conditions. The stereotype automated ‘road centre tendency’ and ‘lane centre tendency’ trajectories received similar likeability ratings as the playback manual driving. An analysis of written comments showed that curve cutting was a reason to believe the car is driving manually, whereas driving at a constant speed or in the centre was associated with automated driving. The sudden stop was the least likeable way to decelerate, but there was no consensus on whether this behaviour was manual or automated. It is concluded that AVs do not have to drive like a human in order to be liked.",

    "abstract": "Aim To determine how well decision tree models can predict tailor-assigned uniform sizes using anthropometry data from the New Zealand Defence Force Anthropometry Survey (NZDFAS). This information may inform automatic sizing systems for military personnel. Methods Anthropometric data from two separate samples of the New Zealand Defence Force military were used. Data on Army personnel from the NZDFAS (n = 583) were used to develop a series of shirt- and trouser-size prediction models based on decision trees. Different combinations of physical, automatic, and post-processed measurements (the latter two derived from a 3D body scan) were trialled, and the models with the highest cross-validation accuracy were retained. The accuracy of these models were then tested on an independent sample of Army recruits (n = 154). Results The automated measurement method (measurements derived automatically by the body scanner software) were the best predictors of shirt size (58.1% accuracy) and trouser size (61.7%), with body weight and waist girth being the strongest predictors. Clothing sizes that were incorrectly predicted by the model where generally one size above or below the tailor-predicted size. Conclusions Anthropometry measurements, when used with decision tree models, show promise for classifying clothing size. Methodological changes such as fitting gender-specific models, using additional anthropometry variables, and testing other data mining techniques are avenues for future work. More research is required before fully automated body scanning is a viable option for obtaining fast and accurate clothing sizes for military clothing and logistics departments.",

    "abstract": "External human-machine interfaces (eHMIs) may be useful for communicating the intention of an automated vehicle (AV) to a pedestrian, but it is unclear which eHMI design is most effective. In a crowdsourced experiment, we examined the effects of (1) colour (red, green, cyan), (2) position (roof, bumper, windshield), (3) message (WALK, DON’T WALK, WILL STOP, WON’T STOP, light bar), (4) activation distance (35 or 50 m from the pedestrian), and (5) the presence of visual distraction in the environment, on pedestrians' perceived safety of crossing the road in front of yielding and non-yielding AVs. Participants (N = 1434) had to press a key when they felt safe to cross while watching a random 40 out of 276 videos of an approaching AV with eHMI. Results showed that (1) green and cyan eHMIs led to higher perceived safety of crossing than red eHMIs; no significant difference was found between green and cyan, (2) eHMIs on the bumper and roof were more effective than eHMIs on the windshield, (3) for yielding AVs, perceived safety was higher for WALK compared to WILL STOP, followed by the light bar; for non-yielding AVs, a red bar yielded similar results to red text, (4) for yielding AVs, a red bar caused lower perceived safety when activated early compared to late, whereas green/cyan WALK led to higher perceived safety when activated late compared to early, and (5) distraction had no significant effect. We conclude that people adopt an egocentric perspective, that the windshield is an ineffective position, that the often-recommended colour cyan may have to be avoided, and that eHMI activation distance has intricate effects related to onset saliency.",

    "abstract": "This study adapted the Demand Resource Evaluation Scores (DRES) as a metacognitive indicator in assessing pilot students’ perceptions during simulated training of a novel maneuver. Typically, positive DRES are associated with perceiving a demanding situation as a challenge and with improved performance, while negative DRES are linked to a perception of the situation as a threat, and to poorer performance. The novelty here was to assess DRES before and after the task and across three missions. Overall, students were found to change their perceptions from threat to challenge over time. Also, increased DRES were positively correlated with performance progressing from mission to mission, indicating that the students reflect on their performance as they advance in their training. These findings show that individual metacognitive evaluations of a stressful aviation maneuver might be important for the progress in performance. The results are discussed in terms of flight safety and pilot training.",

The teamwork development of 16 newly-formed teams training to master a historic tactical drill was evaluated over the course of a week-long residential programme. Training culminated in a timed field gun competition. Teams were trained and mentored in respects to teamwork and taskwork by experienced military instructors. Teamwork was assessed at the outset and end of training. Significant improvements were evident on all teamwork process dimensions, with the greatest improvement seen in teams' shared understanding of teamwork roles and strategies (shared mental models). The lack of an association between teamwork development and final drill performance is explored, as is the utility of the measurement protocol developed for teamwork assessment in other settings.",

    "abstract": "Smartphone use is a risk factor for both neck and shoulder musculoskeletal disorders. The objective of this study was to evaluate an ergonomic arm support prototype device, which may help improve posture while using a smartphone, by determining its effect on muscle activity, muscle fatigue, and neck and shoulder discomfort. Twenty-four healthy young adult smartphone users performed 20 min of smartphone game playing under two different conditions, smartphone use with support prototype device (i.e. intervention condition) and without (i.e. control condition), while neck and shoulder posture were controlled at 0° neck flexion and 30° shoulder flexion. Activity and fatigue of four muscles were measured using surface electromyography (sEMG), these were: anterior deltoid (AD), cervical erector spinae (CES), upper trapezius (UT) and lower trapezius (LT). The intervention condition showed significantly decreased activity of all muscles. Fatigue of all muscles, except LT, significantly increased over time compared to the start point in the control condition. There was no significant difference in muscle fatigue between each time point in the intervention condition. In conclusion, the ergonomic arm support prototype device can be used as ergonomic intervention to reduce neck and shoulder muscle loading and fatigue.",

    "abstract": "Objective Identify whether contextual information may unintentionally alter decision-making during lethal force training. Background Lethal force decisions inherently involve a threat assessment, where an individual learns to identify a threat and use force commensurate to the situation. This decision is ultimately subject to numerous cognitive influences, particularly during training where artificial factors may bias decision-making. Method Participants made threat assessments for tasks that presented hostile stimuli (pointing guns) and non-hostile stimuli (holding cell phones). Experiment 1 identified issues in target design by applying scoring rings as cues to targets, whereas Experiment 2 used bullet holes to assess cues due to target reuse. Experiment 3 applied these cues equally to hostile and non-hostile stimuli to prevent a predictive relationship from forming. Results Significant cueing effects were observed in both Experiments 1 and 2. For Experiment 3, response times were not impacted by the invalid cues as participants could no longer reliably use the cue to distinguish between hostile and non-hostile stimuli. Conclusion Stimulus-related factors can unintentionally create predictive relationships during lethal force training. These predictive factors are problematic because they allow participants to make threat assessments during training in a way that would never be realistic in the field. Application Modifications should be made to hostile and non-hostile targets in equal measure to avoid creating an unintentionally predictive relationship that identifies hostile targets. In practice, scoring rings and bullet holes should be added to non-hostile stimuli to better parallel hostile stimuli.",

    "abstract": "As the prevalence of obesity grows worldwide, it becomes an increasing concern in working populations. Ergonomists are faced with the challenge of accommodating workplace layouts to include this worker demographic. This study investigated the relationship between shoulder and low back isometric joint strengths across body mass index (BMI) groups. Additionally, relationships between body fat percentage (BF%), absolute strength, and strength normalized to body mass were examined. Ninety, healthy, working age participants performed 11 functional and isometric joint strength exertions. BMI group influenced normalized strength, as the obese 2+ (BMI >35.0) group had up to 63.1% lower joint strength than all other BMI groups (p < 0.05). Significant strong to moderate negative linear relationships existed between BF% and normalized strength for both males and females, and relationships were stronger for females. These strength deficits highlight the importance of considering body composition during ergonomics analyses and configuration of occupational tasks.",

    "abstract": "Workers often develop low back pain due to manually lifting heavy loads. Instrumental-based assessment tools are used to quantitatively assess the biomechanical risk in lifting activities. This study aims to verify the hypothesis that high-density surface electromyography (HDsEMG) allows an optimized discrimination of risk levels associated with different fatiguing lifting conditions compared to traditional bipolar sEMG. 15 participants performed three lifting tasks with a progressively increasing lifting index (LI) each lasting 15 min. Erector spinae (ES) activity was recorded using both bipolar and HDsEMG systems. The amplitude of both bipolar and HDsEMG can significantly discriminate each pair of LI. HDsEMG data could discriminate across the different LIs starting from the fourth minute of the task while bipolar sEMG could only do so towards the end. The higher discriminative power of HDsEMG data across the lifting tasks makes such methodology a valuable tool to be used to monitor fatigue while lifting and could extend the possibilities offered by currently available instrumental-based tools.",

    "abstract": "Aim To develop evidence-based role-specific physical employment standards and tests for National Ambulance Resilience Unit (NARU) specialist paramedics. Methods Sixty-two (53 men, 9 women) paramedics performed an array of (1) realistic reconstructions of critical job-tasks (criterion job performance); (2) simplified, easily-replicable simulations of those reconstructions and; (3) fitness tests that are portable and/or practicable to administer with limited resources or specialist equipment. Pearson's correlations and ordinary least products regression were used to assess relationships between tasks and tests. Performance on reconstructions, subject-matter expert and participant ratings were combined to derive minimum acceptable job performance levels, which were used to determine cut-scores on appropriate correlated simulations and tests. Results The majority of performance times were highly correlated with their respective simulations (range of r: 0.73–0.90), with the exception of those replicating water rescue (r range: 0.28–0.47). Regression compatibility intervals provided three cut-scores for each job-task on an appropriate simulation and fitness test. Conclusion This study provides a varied and easily-implementable physical capability assessment for NARU personnel, empirically linked to job performance, with flexible options depending on organisational requirements.",

    "abstract": "A key challenge for designers of healthcare public reports is the development of a presentation format that accurately communicates the variability in the quality of care among healthcare systems. This study conducted in the United States explored whether presenting public report information within narratives and with tests of healthcare quality metrics supported the public report sensemaking process. The study involved 200 participants and employed a 2 (public report information presented in the standard format, presented within a narrative) * 2 (no tests of quality metrics added to standard report, metrics tests added) between-subjects experimental design. The participants viewed the scenario of a patient looking for dialysis facility-related information. They were then asked which dialysis facility they would choose for their care and their level of confidence in their choice. Subsequently, a knowledge quiz evaluating how the participants interpreted the information presented to them, the NASA-TLX workload survey, and a usability questionnaire were administered. The results showed that the probability of choosing the better facility from the perspective of the quality measures included in the report changed from 0.69 to 0.89 when information was presented within a narrative rather than with the standard public report format. The results also found a significantly higher comprehension score (M = 54.58, SD = 18.51) when information was presented within the narrative than when presented in the standard public report format (M = 44.57, SD = 25.13). When information was presented to the participants within a narrative, the narrative may have enabled the participants to visualize themselves as the person depicted in the narrative and this may have increased the perceived relevance of the quality measures. Total workload, mental demand and perceived usability were higher when information was presented within the narrative than when presented in the standard format. The high workload and mental demand may be due to the stress placed on the information processing channels while reading a narrative and the effort expended to relate it to the quality measures. They may also be markers of more deliberative decision making facilitated by the narratives. No significant effect of tests of quality metrics was found on the dependent variables of choice of the better healthcare facility, comprehension, and usability. There was also no significant effect of quality metrics tests on overall workload. However, the effect of quality metrics tests on the mental demand subscale of NASA-TLX was significant. Mental demand was higher without quality metrics tests than with quality metrics tests. No significant interaction was found between the two independent variables on the dependent variables of choice of the better healthcare facility, comprehension, workload, and usability. It is recommended that narratives be used to present public report information to support informed healthcare decisions.",

    "abstract": "This study sought to test the validity of radio frequency identification (RFID) technology to measure indoor stair walking. RFID and Bluetooth sensors (accelerometers with the proximity function) were placed at landings across three floors within a stairwell. Participants (n = 29) were randomized to stair walking or sedentary control and concomitantly wore RFID tags at the hip, chest and neck. An accelerometer worn at the hip captured criterion physical activity data. RFID devices detected sedentary control and stair walking participants (mean RFID detections: 15.50, 47.33 respectively). Neck lanyard RFID tags were detected most frequently. RFID correctly classified all participants in both groups. RFID-based energy expenditure estimates were strongly correlated with accelerometer estimates (r = 0.78–0.94). Percent agreement for floor detection between the Bluetooth and RFID readers (38.6%) was consistent with known limitations of Bluetooth proximity sensing. It is concluded that, during self-paced stair walking in young adults, RFID devices provide valid data on participant movement and estimated energy expenditure.",

    "abstract": "Prolonged and intensive vibration exposures during the grinding of handheld workpieces may cause hand-arm vibration syndrome. The objectives of this study are to develop an on-the-hand method for evaluating vibration-reducing (VR) gloves, and to determine whether VR gloves can significantly reduce the vibration exposures. A worker holding and pressing a typical workpiece (golf club head) against a grinding wheel or belt in order to shape the workpiece was simulated, and the input vibration and those on the workpiece and hand-arm system were measured. Ten human subjects participated in the experiment. The results demonstrate that VR gloves significantly reduced the vibrations at the palm, hand dorsum, and wrist. The grinding interface condition and hand feed force did not substantially affect glove effectiveness. The use of gloves slightly increased the workpiece resonant response, but the resonant response did not significantly affect glove effectiveness. This study concluded that the use of VR gloves can help control vibration exposures of workers performing grinding of handheld workpieces.",

    "abstract": "The introduction of automated vehicles (AVs) into urban areas initially leads to mixed traffic, consisting of AVs, human drivers, and vulnerable road users. Since the AV's passenger is no longer actively involved in the driving task, there may be changes in the interaction between AVs and surrounding human road users. Therefore, it is essential for an AV to behave in a comprehensible manner in order to maintain or even enhance traffic efficiency and traffic safety. This work investigates the interaction of an AV and a simultaneously oncoming human driver at road bottlenecks due to double-parked vehicles on both sides of the road. Based on findings derived from AV-pedestrian interaction, comfort limits in terms of driving dynamics, and traffic observations, we designed nine AV movements to either yield the right of way or to insist on it by varying the AV's speed (maintain speed, one-step deceleration, two-step deceleration) and its lateral offset (no offset, close offset, distant offset). The different vehicle movements were evaluated with 34 participants in a driving simulator study. The results show participants' shorter passing times, fewer crashes, and significantly higher ratings of the AV's communication if the AV movement contained a lateral offset. In addition to the regular encounters, we analyzed the controllability of an automation failure and its aftereffect on participants' trust in AVs. The experience of the automation failure reduced the trust rating significantly. From the results we conclude that the AV should communicate the right of way not only via speed adjustments but also via the performance of a lateral offset to enhance traffic efficiency and safety. Moreover, a change in the AV's maneuver due to an automation failure must be avoided since it is not controllable by the human driver.",

    "abstract": "Background Soldiers are required to conduct tasks and operations in physically demanding situations, where the ability to move (mobility) quickly is important to lethality and survivability. This study employed a specially designed suit to try to isolate the main mass property characteristics of personal protective clothing/equipment (PPCE) including mass, bulk and stiffness as much as possible and evaluated their effects on soldier performance across operationally-relevant mobility tasks. Method Eight male military subjects performed the load effects assessment program (LEAP) obstacle course while wearing 7 different configurations of specifically designed suit: unencumbered (control), 10 kg mass, 30 kg mass, 20 L bulk, medium stiffness, high stiffness and a mixed configuration consisting of 10 kg mass, 20 L bulk and medium stiffness. The primary outcome measure was total LEAP completion time. Additionally, heart rate, rating of perceived exertion (RPE), range of motion and vertical jump heights were measured and related to LEAP performance. Results All configurations degraded or tended to degrade the total LEAP completion times (p-value < 0.05), except for the medium stiffness configuration. Heart rate did not differ significantly between configurations, while RPE scores of configurations 30 kg and mix were significantly higher compared to control (p < 0.01). Conclusion Mass, bulk and stiffness all negatively influence LEAP obstacle performance. Therefore, all three have to be considered when trying to reduce the physical burden on soldiers.",

    "abstract": "The road environment has changed markedly over the years. Train horns are ostensibly used to alert road users and are typically mandatory on approach to railway level crossings. However, they have increasingly been seen as a nuisance. Beyond their negative aspects, a study has yet to comprehensively evaluate train horn effectiveness and understand if they remain beneficial and relevant in the contemporary environment. Hence, this study aimed to provide evidence on the actual use of train horns. Field observations were conducted at 54 railway crossings across four Australian States. The effects of level crossing type, location, and environmental conditions were investigated in relation to train horn loudness as objectively measured at the crossing. Results revealed that train horns were not always used, presenting an issue for passive level crossings. However, when sounded, train horn use was redundant and insufficiently loud at level crossings equipped with bells. Taken together, current train horn practice was found to be highly variable and dependent on crossing type, remoteness, and individual train drivers, thus resulting in inconsistent warnings and raising important implications for standardisation.",

    "abstract": "Manual harvesting is still prevalent in the agricultural industry. Accordingly, it is one of the largest contributors toward work-related musculoskeletal disorder. The cutting task in oil palm harvesting uses a long pole and involves repetitive and forceful motion of the upper limbs. Exoskeleton technology is increasingly explored to assist manual tasks performance in manufacturing and heavy industries, mainly for reducing discomfort and injuries, and improving productivity. This paper reports an initial investigation on the feasibility of using an upper limb exoskeleton to assist oil palm harvesting tasks. Previous studies highlighted that exoskeletons for agricultural activities should be adaptable to changing field tasks, tools and equipment. The immediate difference in the activity of three muscles were analyzed for a range of harvesting-simulated tasks. Lower activities were observed for tasks involving overhead work when using the prototype. Nevertheless, users’ feedback highlighted that its design should be optimized for better acceptance.",

    "abstract": "Objectives The aim of this study was to assess current perceptions of heat stress, fatigue and recovery practices during active duty in Australian firefighters. Design Prospective survey. Methods 473 firefighters from Fire and Rescue New South Wales completed a two-part, 16-item survey. Questions included perceptions of the operational activities and body areas associated with the most heat stress, the most mentally and physically demanding activities, and levels of fatigue felt. Further questions focussed on the use and importance of recovery practices, effectiveness of currently used heat-mitigation strategies and additional cooling strategies for future use. Results Around a third of firefighters (62%) reported structural fire-fighting as the hottest operational activities experienced, followed by bushfire-fighting (51%) and rescue operations (38%). The top three responses for which body-parts get the hottest ranked as ‘the head’ (58%), ‘the whole body’ (54%) and ‘the upper back’ (40%), respectively. The majority of firefighters (~90%) stated they always or sometimes use the opportunity to recover at an incident, with the top three being ‘sit in the shade’ (93%), ‘cold water ingestion (drinking)’ (90%) and ‘removing your helmet, flash hood and jacket’ (89%). Firefighters reported higher usefulness for more easily deployed strategies compared to more advanced strategies. Limited age and gender differences were found, although location of active service differences were present. Conclusion These findings may inform future research, and translation to operational directives for recovery interventions; including exploration of protective gear and clothing, education, resources and provision of cooling methods, as well as recovery aid development.",

    "abstract": "Current taxonomies for assessing foot strategies in manual material handling lack exhaustive classification of foot movements and foot positioning. They also fail to consider different instants of the task as checkpoints to relate foot strategies. The goal of the study was first to develop a new taxonomy to assess foot positions and motions considering those limitations. The second goal was to assess reliability and reproducibility using raw agreement percentages, Cohen's kappa, prevalence-adjusted, bias-adjusted kappa and Gwet's AC1. A filmed task consisted of transferring boxes from one pallet to another. Intra- and inter-rater reliability were assessed reviewing 23% and 10%, respectively, of video data. Reproducibility and reliability results are substantial and almost perfect on average. In comparison to similar studies, reproducibility and reliability were considered acceptable.",

    "abstract": "Patient handling related musculoskeletal injuries are prevalent among Emergency Medical Service (EMS) providers. The first step in many patient handling situations is where a supine patient on the floor is brought to a sitting position. This study investigated whether a strap, placed under the patient's torso and long enough that EMS providers can perform the patient raising task in a standing posture, reduced muscular effort. Fifteen participants raised a simulated patient, with the help of an assistant, using the strap method and a traditional method (grasping the shoulders) in an open area, a restricted space, and in a bathtub. Torso postures improved in all location conditions when using the strap. The muscle activation data showed mixed results. While EMG responses from the latissimus dorsi muscles were reduced, EMG activity of the erector spinae muscles increased when the strap was used. Perceived effort assessments supported the use of the strap.",

    "abstract": "It is important to understand how the hand and fingers elongate and contract with hand posture for optimally fitting and comfortable gloves. Nevertheless, the measurement and analysis of the finger segments for glove designs remain largely neglected. Here, the length and proportion of the finger segments when splayed and during gripping, and between the dorsal and palm sides of 30 participants are 3D scanned and analysed. The full digit lengths change by 7.6–11.9% with hand posture, but the finger segment changes are not proportional. The ratios of the fingertip to distal interphalangeal joint/full digit, and fingertip to the proximal interphalangeal joint/full digit, are important variables. The results are validated with 10 more subjects based on ratings of a ready-to-wear sports glove. Inaccurate proportioning of the finger regions causes shifting which results in displacement and discomfort. This research contributes to glove pattern engineering, with a focus on the finger segments.",

    "abstract": "Purpose To analyze progression of changes in kinematics and work physiology during progressive lifting in healthy adults. Methods Healthy participants were recruited. A standardized lifting test from the WorkWell Functional Capacity Evaluation (FCE) was administered, with five progressive lifting low series of five repetitions. The criteria of the WorkWell observation protocol were studied: changes in muscle use (EMG), heart rate (heart rate monitor), base of support, posture and movement pattern (motion capture system). Repeated measures ANOVA's were used to analyze changes during progressive workloads. Results 18 healthy young adults participated (8 men, 10 women; mean age 22 years). Mean maximum weight lifted was 66 (±3.2) and 44 (±7.4) kg for men and women, respectively. With progressive loads, statistically significant (p < 0.01) differences were observed: increase in secondary muscle use at moderate lifting, increase of heart rate, increase of base of support and movement pattern changes were observed; differences in posture were not significant. Conclusions Changes in 4 out of 5 kinematic and work physiology parameters were objectively quantified using lab technology during progressive lifting in healthy adults. These changes appear in line with existing observation criteria.",

    "abstract": "A single sacrum mounted inertial measurement unit (IMU) was employed to analyze warfighter performance on a bounding rush (prone-sprinting-prone) task. Thirty-nine participants (23M/16F) performed a bounding rush task consisting of four bounding rush cycles. The sacrum mounted IMU recorded angular velocity and acceleration data were used to provide estimates of sacral velocity and position. Individual rush cycles were parsed into three principal movement phases; namely, the get up, sprint, and get down phases. The timing of each phase was analyzed, averaged for each participant, and compared to the overall rush cycle time using regression analysis. A cluster analysis further reveals differences between high and low performers. Get down time was most predictive of bounding rush performance (R2 = 0.75) followed by get up time (R2 = 0.58) and sprint time (R2 = 0.40). Comparing high and low performers, the get down time exhibited nearly twice the effect on mean rush cycle time compared to get up time (effect size of −2.61 to −1.46, respectively). Overall, this IMU-based method reveals key features of the bounding rush that govern performance. Consequently, this objective method may support future training regimens and performance standards for military recruits, and parallel applications for athletes.",

    "abstract": "Fatigue is a critically important aspect of crew endurance in submarine operations, with continuously high fatigue being associated with increased risk of human error and long-term negative health ramifications. Submarines pose several unique challenges to fatigue mitigation, including requirements for continuous manning for long durations, a lack of access to critical environmental zeitgebers (stimuli pertinent to circadian physiology; e.g., natural sunlight), and work, rest and sleep occurring within an encapsulated environment. In this paper, we examine the factors that underlie fatigue in such a context with the aim of evaluating the predictive utility of a biomathematical model (BMM) of fatigue. Three experience sampling studies were conducted with submarine crews using a participant-led measurement protocol that included assessments of subjective sleepiness, workload (NASA-Task Load Index [TLX] and a bespoke underload-overload scale), and sleep. As expected, results indicated that predicting KSS with a BMM approach outperformed more conventional linear modelling approaches (e.g., time-of-day, sleep duration, time awake). Both the homeostatic and circadian components of the BMM were significantly associated with KSS and used as controls in the workload models. We found increased NASA-TLX workload was significantly associated with increased average KSS ratings at the between-person level. However, counter to expectations, the two workload measures were not found to have significant linear or quadratic relationship with fatigue at the within-person level. An important outcome of the research is that applied fatigue researchers should be extremely cautious applying conventional linear predictors when predicting fatigue. Practical implications for the submarine and related extreme work context are discussed. Important avenues for continued research are outlined, including directly estimating BMM parameters.",

The aim of this study was to explore issues that female soldiers experience with current Australian Defence Force (ADF)-issue body armour. Following a sequential exploratory design, an initial questionnaire was completed by 97 Australian female soldiers. Subsequently, 33 Australian female soldiers participated in one of three focus groups. Descriptive statistics of questionnaire data considered alongside thematic analysis of focus group transcripts revealed problems with the design (fit, form and function) of current ADF-issue body armour, as well as problems with the issuance and education surrounding use of the system. It is recommended that anthropometric data of female soldiers be better incorporated into future body armour designs, that these data inform processes surrounding both acquisition and issuance of body armour and that training protocols for body armour use be reviewed.",

    "abstract": "The aim of this cross-sectional mixed-method study was to understand the current use, and practices to support the implementation, of sit-stand workstations (SSWs) from the perspective of furniture purchasing decision makers in Australian organisations. An online survey, and in-depth interviews with a purposive sub-sample were conducted. A total of 216 eligible participants from 150 organisations across 18 sectors completed the survey with 17 interviews conducted. 40% of organisations provided SSWs on request while 41% reported not using them appropriately. Over half provided no training on the appropriate use of SSWs (n = 109, 51%) nor used any strategies to enhance their use (n = 163, 84%). From the interviews, SSWs were perceived effective in reducing discomforts and increasing employees’ satisfaction and productivity. Lack of resources and guidelines to support SSW usage, and lack of wellbeing knowledge, were identified as barriers. Education and ongoing monitoring are important to enhance the appropriate use and uptake of SSWs.",

    "abstract": "Pedestrians rely on vehicle dynamics, engine sound, and driver cues. The lack of engine sound now constitutes an addressed pedestrian safety issue for (hybrid) electric vehicles ((H)EVs). Analogously, lacking driver cues may constitute a pedestrian safety issue for self-driving vehicles (SDVs). The purpose of this study was to systematically compare the relevance of substituting driver cues with an external human-machine interface among SDVs (no eHMI vs. eHMI) with the relevance of substituting engine sound with artificial sound among (H)EVs (no engine sound vs. engine sound). In a within-subject design, twenty-nine participants acting as pedestrians encountered a simulated SDV in a parking lot. The results revealed that both informational cues have equally large effects on subjective measures such as perceived safety. In semi-structured interviews, participants stated that it is equally crucial to equip SDVs with an eHMI as equipping (H)EVs with an artificial sound generator. We conclude that an eHMI for SDVs seems to be as relevant as an artificial sound for (H)EVs.",

The driving simulator study was aimed at examining differences in mental load while navigating in an urban area with ambiguous intersection situations (N = 59). The navigation information was presented to the driver through a head-up display (HUD): a conventional HUD or an AR display, which relates information to the surroundings. Additionally, the driver had to solve a non-driving-related task (NDRT) which was an auditory cognitive, spatial task. Results showed that while driving with the AR display, participants performed better in the NDRT, which indicates a reduced mental load compared with the HUD. Participants drove on average 3 km/h slower with the HUD, showing compensation behaviour.",

However, no studies have assessed the effectiveness of this training for work at heights (WAH). This paper aimed to synthesize the outcomes criteria for measuring the effectiveness of virtual safety training of WAH in different work sectors. A total of 658 records were identified through an explorative search of relevant citations from 2010 onwards. Only 21 documents were considered and classified according to the training goal: improvement of knowledge, skills or attitudes. Outcomes criteria of virtual safety training were analyzed according to Kirkpatrick's model. The results support practitioners and safety managers by providing an inventory of training methods, evaluation indicators and evaluation effects. Further recommendations are made for the design of an effective training assessment.",

    "doi": "10.1016/j.apergo.2021.103420",
    "abstract": "As the nature of human-robot relationships have become increasingly bound to shift from supervisor–machine to friend–companion, people have exhibited an increasing interest in making social judgments toward such anthropomorphic objects, such as trustworthiness. However, the facial features of social robots and their potential effect on anthropomorphic trustworthiness are seldom analyzed and discussed comprehensively. This study examined whether the trustworthiness perception toward a social robot shared similarity with baby schema features on the human face. It also explored the effects of different combinations of baby schema facial features, especially the positions and sizes of the eyes and mouth, on facial anthropomorphic trustworthiness. A 5-way mixed experiment (N = 270) was conducted accordingly. The results indicated that people would experience a high level of facial anthropomorphic trustworthiness toward robots with baby schema features (i.e., large eyes, with medium vertical and horizontal positions of the eyes and mouth). This paper contributes to the literature on facial anthropomorphic trustworthiness in human-robot interaction and provides suggestions for social robot design.",

Both precursory users and experts are known for their deep knowledge of the studied field. In this study, we conducted 36 needs anticipation interviews with ordinary users, precursory users and experts, in order to determine the contribution of each profile to the identification of future needs. The lexical and manual analysis of the interviews shows that the precursory users' speech is the most valuable in terms of both richness and novelty. The discourse of the experts is also richer and more original than that of the ordinary users and differs from that of the precursory users: professional-based for the experts and experience-based for the precursory users. We therefore recommend the inclusion of both experts and precursory users in the need's analysis and anticipation phase.",

    "abstract": "During pregnancy, anthropometric and physiological changes can result in difficulty reaching for and lifting everyday objects. The aims of this study were to determine the changes in sagittal plane anterior reach space (SPARS) and shoulder/elbow strength requirements throughout pregnancy. Seventeen participants were tested through a longitudinal observational cohort study between 16 and 36 weeks gestation in four-week intervals. A 25% decrease in SPARS was observed at the L3-4 torso height. Combined with arm mass increases, shoulder and elbow moment requirements at the minimum and maximum static reach distances significantly increased. However, inverse dynamics analysis determined that mass gains in the arm alone only minimally impact dynamic shoulder moments. Additionally, torso flexion increases throughout pregnancy demonstrates that women are attempting to compensate for decreased SPARS, possibly indicating the additional perceptual importance of reach space in accommodations for pregnant workers.",

    "abstract": "In immersive virtual reality (VR) environments, users rely on the vision channel to search for objects. Such eyes-engaged interactive techniques may significantly degrade the interaction efficiency and user experience, particularly when users have to turn their head frequently to search for a target object in the limited field of view (FOV) of a head-mounted display (HMD). In this study, we systematically investigated user capabilities in eyes-free spatial target acquisition considering different horizontal angles, vertical angles, distances from the user's body, and body sides. Our results show that high acquisition accuracy and low task load are achieved for target locations at front and middle horizontal angles as well as those at middle vertical angles. Meanwhile, a trade-off cannot be achieved between the acquisition accuracy and the task load for target locations at long distances from the user's body. In addition, the acquisition accuracy and task load for the target locations vary with the body side. Our research findings can provide a deeper understanding of user capability in eyes-free target acquisition and offer concrete design guidelines for appropriate target arrangement for eyes-free target acquisition in immersive VR environments.",

    "abstract": "In healthcare, most accidents occur as a result of inadequate interactions between system components rather than component failures. In such cases traditional risk analysis methods are of limited use for analysing system safety, so methods such as Systems Theoretic Process Analysis (STPA) and the Functional Resonance Analysis Method (FRAM) have been developed. This study uses STPA to assess risks in the sepsis treatment process, discusses the potential value STPA adds and compares the results of STPA with the results of another study that used FRAM. The findings indicate that STPA and FRAM have different strengths which reflect the different scientific approaches behind these two methods. FRAM facilitates an in-depth understanding of a system, while STPA allows for more comprehensive risk analysis by identifying more risks, scenarios and safety recommendations. Nevertheless, it is reasonable to say that not only does STPA provide more comprehensive risk analysis; its terminology and philosophy are also closer to the current safety management applications employed in complex systems.",

    "doi": "10.1016/j.apergo.2021.103385",
    "abstract": "Objectives This systematic review and meta-analysis determined the effects of using an exoskeleton during occupational tasks on physical stress and strain compared to not using an exoskeleton. Methods Systematic electronic database searches were performed and the review was prepared according to the PRISMA guidelines. Treatment effects on the predefined outcomes were calculated using standardized mean differences for continuous outcomes in several meta-analyses using Review Manager 5.3. Registration: PROSPERO (CRD42020168701). Results 63 articles were included in qualitative syntheses and 52 in quantitative, but most of them did not extensively evaluate musculoskeletal stress and strain and the risk of bias was rated high for all included studies. Statistically significant effects of using back, upper-limb, or lower-limb exoskeletons have been observed in the supported body areas (e.g. reduced muscle activity, joint moments and perceived strain). Studies which did not exclusively focus on the supported body area also showed statistically significant effects in the non-supported areas (e.g. changed muscle activity and perceived strain) and in physiological outcomes (e.g. reduced energy expenditure). Conclusions Using an exoskeleton during occupational tasks seems to reduce user's acute physical stress and strain in the exoskeleton's target area. However, impact on workers' health is still unknown, primarily because of missing long-term evaluations under real working conditions. Furthermore, this systematic review highlights a lack of studies (1) following high quality methodological criteria, (2) evaluating various inter-related stress and strain parameters instead of only focusing on one specific, and (3) evaluating non-target body areas instead of only the directly supported body area.",

    "abstract": "Shared perceptions of a task among those responsible for its completion are important for achieving successful outcomes. This study proposes a framework for eliciting various aspects of team members' “mental models” (TMMs) of complex medical tasks. The intention is to provide ‘proof of concept’ for a methodology to measure similarities and differences between team members' perceptions of selected attributes of the task. Applying our framework in a gynecology ward, we use cognitive interviewing and concept mapping to reveal differences between the TMMs of doctor and nurse teams. These group differences are found to reflect limited awareness of the other group's level of involvement, workload, responsibilities and contributions to quality of care. We argue that such differences may lead to frustration, conflict, poor teamwork and risks to patient safety; but once identified, and subject to certain limitations, the differences could be used to develop interventions that will enhance teamwork.",

    "abstract": "This study evaluated the potential mismatch between vacuum-sealed jar opening demands and wrist torque strength of 758 (384 males and 374 females) participants aged 5–74 years in Iran. Wrist ulnar/radial (U/R) torque strength of participants and required torque for opening the existing jars (with 2 different sizes – 65 mm and 85 mm diameter lids) were measured using a digital angle torque adaptor and then compared together to identify any potential mismatch between them. The mismatch percentages were defined as the number of participants whose maximal wrist U/R torque strength were lower than the minimum required torque strength for opening the vacuum-sealed jars. Minimum required torque strength for opening the existing 65 mm and 85 mm vacuum-sealed jars were 4.1 Nm and 6.6 Nm, respectively (range = 4.1 Nm to 10.2 Nm). A considerable mismatch (range = 25%–100%) was found between the required torque strength for opening the existing jars and the wrist U/R torque strength of the study population, particularly for females and those aged 5–9 years. A torque limit of 1.8 Nm was proposed for opening jars for the entire population.",

    "doi": "10.1016/j.apergo.2021.103399",
    "abstract": "Instantaneous consumption displays (ICDs) can be used as central information source to perceive the energy efficiency of manoeuvre-level driving. A key question is whether drivers who use ICDs can accurately derive energy efficiency differences of different driving strategies based on ICDs. There is reason to assume that drivers' consumption judgements may be biased, similar to driving-related phenomena like the time-saving bias. Therefore, the aim of the present research was to examine drivers’ accuracy in deriving average consumption from dynamic ICD sequences. Participants viewed videos of a schematic ICD in a controlled experiment where the maximum instantaneous consumption systematically varied over time. Participants (N = 55) overestimated the average consumption values. The empirical ranking of the sequences did significantly correlate with the heuristic but not with the correct efficiency ranking. The current study incorporated multilevel modelling due to the nested structure of the data. The estimation difference was greater with higher peak height and shorter peak duration. The effect of peak height on estimation difference weakened with longer peak duration. In sum, the results indicate that ICDs can create biased perceptions of energy efficiency and that drivers seem to use simplifying heuristics. Knowledge and affinity for technology interaction appear to relate to biased estimations, whereas the intensity of prior experience with consumption displays seems irrelevant. Further studies should test other interfaces with debiasing potential such as manoeuvre-based aggregation or fading-trace approaches. Moreover, studies are needed that enable modelling of the effects of more natural temporal-spatial visual attention distribution (e.g. in a driving simulator setting).",

    "abstract": "Introduction Military leaders must understand how modern military equipment loads affect trade-offs between movement speed and physiological strain to optimize pacing strategies. Purpose To evaluate the effects of load carried in a recently developed military backpack on the walking speed and cardiometabolic responses of dismounted warfighters. Methods Fifteen soldiers (1 woman, 14 men; age, 22 ± 2 years; height, 173 ± 7 cm; body mass (BM), 73 ± 10 kg) completed incremental walking tests with four external load conditions (0, 22, 44, or 66% BM) using the US Army's newest backpack: the Modular Lightweight Load-Carrying Equipment 4000 (MOLLE 4000). Oxygen uptake (V̇O2) and heart rate (HR) were evaluated relative to maximal values (V̇O2max and HRmax respectively). Testing ceased when participants completed the highest tested speed (1.97 m s−1), exceeded a respiratory exchange ratio (RER) of 1.00, or reached volitional exhaustion. Results Peak speed significantly decreased (p < 0.03) with successively heavier loads (0% BM, 1.95 ± 0.06 m s−1; 22% BM, 1.87 ± 0.10 m s−1; 44% BM, 1.69 ± 0.13 m s−1; 66% BM, 1.48 ± 0.13 m s−1). Peak V̇O2 was significantly lower (p < 0.01) with 0% BM (47 ± 5% V̇O2max) than each load (22% BM, 58 ± 8% V̇O2max; 44% BM, 63 ± 10% V̇O2max; 66% BM, 61 ± 11% V̇O2max). Peak HR was significantly lower (p < 0.01) with 0% BM (71 ± 5% HRmax) versus each load (22% BM, 83 ± 6% HRmax; 44% BM, 87 ± 6% HRmax; 66% BM, 88 ± 6% HRmax). Conclusion Overburdened warfighters suffer severe impairments in walking speed even when carrying recently developed military load carriage equipment. Our results suggest that the relative work intensity of heavy load carriage may be better described when expressed relative to HRmax versus V̇O2max.",

    "abstract": "Insulin is a high-risk medicine that has been implicated in serious adverse events for hospital inpatients, including medication-error related deaths. Most insulin errors occur during administration, and “wrong dose” is the most common type. A paper-based subcutaneous insulin chart (the “NSIC”) was developed for the Australian Commission on Safety and Quality in Health Care, using a range of human factors methods, with the aim of reducing the opportunity for errors. The present lab-based study empirically assessed whether the NSIC's human factors design translates into improved user-performance in the determination of insulin doses, compared with a pre-existing chart. Forty-one experienced nurses and 48 novice chart-users completed 60 experimental trials (30 per chart), in which they determined doses to administer to patients. Both groups determined insulin doses faster, and made fewer dose errors, when using the NSIC. These results support the utility of the usability heuristics employed in developing the chart.",

The aim of this study was to assess its usability in a rehabilitation setting. Eleven physical therapists (PTs) integrated the T-Chair into the therapy programs of 15 patients post stroke. Each patient performed on average four individual therapy sessions on the T-Chair under the PTs' supervision. Usability was assessed using questionnaires, therapy diaries and focus group interviews with PTs'. Among PTs’, 64% had generally a positive view on the T-Chair. Physical therapists recognized the potential for unsupervised therapy. Generally, patients reacted positively and enjoyed training. The T-Chair has the potential to become an adequate training tool for patients with an intermediate trunk control after stroke.

Training instructors utilize a variety of methods to ensure military and law enforcement personnel do not inflict unintended casualties. However, there is little empirical evidence about the best methods to design a shooting simulation that might evoke these errors, which is critical to ensure the validity of any assessment or training exercise. The current study analyzed performance across a variety of simulated shooting scenarios developed and applied for military training purposes. Several factors were assessed based upon either the scenario or human performance. Scenario type, number of shots fired, and the ratio of hostiles-to-non-hostiles were significant predictors for the likelihood of inflicting an unintended casualty. This collected evidence should help improve scenario design for future training simulations that will help avoid these critical shooting errors.",

    "abstract": "This study compared ground reaction forces (GRF) and lower limb two-dimensional (2D) kinematic waveforms, with and without load carriage, in military personnel walking in two different types of boots. Data were measured in 24-soldiers walking on a 10-m walkway under four randomized crossover trials: wearing two military boots (styrene-butadiene rubber midsole – SBR – 63 Shore A; and polyurethane midsole – PU – 48 Shore A); with and without a 15-kg backpack. GRF traditional parameters were evaluated by two-way ANOVAs. GRF and kinematic waveforms were assessed using a statistical parametric mapping (SPM) method (two-way ANOVA). No interaction effects were observed between footwear and load. GRF at the beginning of stance was lower while wearing the SBR boot condition compared to the PU boot condition. Load carriage increased trunk, hip, and knee flexion. The analyzed military boots did not affect movement patterns during loaded walking and the military boot with SBR midsole material reduced impact to a greater extent. The study demonstrated that the design and materials (e.g., midsole material and thickness) used in boot manufacturing can influence military boot performance.",

    "abstract": "Eye movements as the indicators of human information processing have been studied in many domains. However, it is not clear how users’ eye movements differ among specific product attribute, while visual impression of a product plays a crucial part in distinguishing product designs. Therefore, this paper attempts to establish guidance for exploring eye tracking applications in design concept validations through two case studies. The first case study investigated the product attributes based on the theory of cognitive-affective emotions. The second investigated the product attributes for apparent functionality and affective quality. The eye movements of 105 participants were analyzed when they evaluated the products images. The results indicated that product attributes perceived in evaluation tasks can be predicted from eye movements. Moreover, compared to the new users, experienced users had a longer mean fixation duration and tended to form their impressions of the product from multiple components.",

    "abstract": "People visiting different Government Hospitals at Jabalpur in central India, were facing problems in comprehending different symbols. One of such hospital authority approached the research team for developing new symbols which could be easily comprehended by the users. Based on this, the current study was conducted, which included two experiments. The first experiment dealt with the ergonomic evaluation and identification of problems associated with the existing symbols. New concepts were then developed based on Ergonomic principles and users’ feedback. The second experiment focused upon testing of the new concepts on the target users. Results of Experiment 1 indicated that the mean comprehension level was 22.3% for all the existing symbols (n = 41). Low scores (on a scale of 1–10) were found for the existing symbol for ergonomic principles (mean value was 1.9 for Compatibility, 2.1 for Familiarity, and 2.0 for Standardisation). Redesigned concepts of the symbols were tested on the target users, the result indicated an improvement in comprehensibility of newly designed symbols. The mean comprehension level for 53 new/redesigned symbols was 70.2%, which included redesign of 41 orignal and inclusion of 12 new symbols. High scores (on a scale of 1–10) were received for all the new symbols for ergonomic principles (the mean value was 8.4 for Compatibility, 8.5 for Familiarity, and 8.5 for Standardisation). Findings of this study may be helpful for the researchers working in the domain of information ergonomics in space related to healthcare sector or similar areas.",

Linear arm strengths were collected from 15 female participants, at four hand locations and six primary directions (n = 360), and then estimated with 3DSSPP incorporating each participant's own segment lengths, body masses and joint strengths, and the measured arm postures from each trial to optimize the accuracy of 3DSSPP. In spite of this, the errors in 3DSSPP's estimated arm strength values were very high (RMS error = 56.0 N and 40.4%) and poorly correlated (r2 = 29.2%) with measured strengths. These results seriously question the accuracy of 3DSSPP to estimate female linear arm strengths and percent capable values, for the range of conditions tested, likely due to the overly simplified assumptions made to estimate triaxial shoulder strength.",

Using the work-systems model as a guiding framework, we conducted 15 in-depth interviews with employees of an oil company located on an island in the Persian Gulf to investigate work system-related stressors. The interviews were audio-taped, and qualitative content data analysis was carried out continuously and simultaneously with data collection over a 12-month period. 1118 meaning codes were extracted which could be understood though fourteen categories of stressor associated with the five themes of the work system. Employees reported the job was stressful primarily because of organizational structural problems and management attributes, although aspects of living and working on the small island were also difficult. These results provide direction for intervention that can dovetail with risk assessment of occupational health of workers.",

    "abstract": "Objective Providing instruction for assembly tasks is essential in modern manufacturing industry, as well as in households for customers that buy products to be assembled at home. Recent technological developments might be able to assist in completing an assembly task faster and more accurately. The aim of this study was to evaluate whether performance and usability differs when instructions for an assembly task are presented on digital glasses versus paper. Methods Participants (n = 63) completed one of three versions of an assembly task (between-subject-design) with LEGO® bricks: (1) with paper instruction (P), (2) with text instructions presented stepwise via digital glasses (GT), (3) with stepwise text and auditory instruction (in parallel) on digital glasses (GA). Outcome measures on performance were completion time and errors. Furthermore, usability was measured by the User Experience Questionnaire, the Standardized Usability Questionnaire, the Post-Study Usability Questionnaire, and cognitive processing skills were assessed by the Trail Making Test and different versions of the Eriksen Flanker Task. Analyses were adjusted for the confounding factors age, gender, experience with glasses and LEGO, and problems with instruction. Results Findings indicate that task completion was faster with the paper instructions compared to both versions of instruction via digital glasses (GT, GA). We observed no difference in accuracy and usability between the instructions. “Novelty” was rated higher for instructions for both GT and GA, compared to P. Discussion Results show that instructions on digital glasses may not always be more effective for assembly than the traditional paper-based instructions. Further studies are necessary to investigate whether effectiveness may depend on task complexity, target group, experience of the user with task and device, and how the information is presented.",

    "abstract": "Activity-based workplaces (ABWs) are becoming popular in Western countries and were implemented at four office sites of a large Swedish government agency. A fifth office was used as a control group. The study aim was to examine the effects of relocation to ABW on perceived productivity among employees and to determine if perceived change-oriented leadership behavior prior to relocation moderates potential effects. Data were collected three months prior to relocation, and three and 12 months after. 407 respondents were included in linear mixed regression models. Perceived productivity decreased significantly after relocation compared to the control group and these effects persisted 12 months after the relocation. However, the decrease in perceived productivity was significantly smaller among employees perceiving high change-oriented leadership before relocation. Our results point out the importance of a change-oriented leadership behavior during the implementation to avoid productivity loss among employees when implementing ABWs.",

    "doi": "10.1016/j.apergo.2021.103378",
    "abstract": "Occupational tasks often involve musculoskeletal demands that contribute to injury risk. In pallet wrapping tasks, 36% of workplace claims involve over exertion and repetitive exposures (Workplace Safety and Prevention Services, 2012). Tools that modify how the wrap is handled by workers have been introduced to help mitigate over exertion and extreme postures wherever possible. A novel device has been introduced that places the required tension on the roll to mitigate these factors. However, the effect of reducing the necessary tension on the roll during pallet wrapping in limiting muscular demand and extreme postures is unknown. Fourteen healthy university aged participants completed 12 wrapping trials on a simulated pallet (2 repetitions of 2 wrapping techniques (device, hand wrapping) at 3 wrapping heights (low, medium, high)). Surface electromyography (sEMG) was measured on 6 shoulder and 2 low back muscles; anterior and middle deltoids, biceps brachii, infraspinatus, supraspinatus, upper trapezius, and erector spinae (T8 & L3). Kinematic data were collected for the torso and upper extremity and global to torso, and torso to upper arm angles were computed. Repeated measures ANOVAs were performed for the following experimental factors: 1) technique used (device or hand wrapping) and 2) the wrapping height (low, medium, high) for each muscle (8), angle (5), rating of perceived discomfort (1) and rating of perceived exertion (1). Pallet wrapping without a device required greater trunk flexion at lower heights and thoracohumeral elevation at higher wrapping heights as compared to using the device. Muscular activation increased when using the device, specifically at the higher and lower heights. Posture and muscular demands during pallet wrapping tasks are sensitive to both wrapping technique and wrapping height. Ergonomics interventions such as this device may mitigate postural risks associated with manual material handling tasks.",

Methods This was a pre-post cross-sectional intervention study with two underground coal mines. Participant-surveys were collected at baseline and 12-months. Results There were no significant differences in musculoskeletal discomfort between the two sites in any body region. Tasks were rotated two to three times a shift on average. Conclusions The task rotation schedule did not have a significant impact upon musculoskeletal discomfort although this does not necessarily reflect that the rotation schedule was in-effective in curbing injury, rather highlights the complexity of developing a successful task rotation schedule within an underground coal mine. The task rotation schedule, its implementation and execution need consideration and further investigation to assist in effectively controlling injury and fatigue risk.",

    "abstract": "The main purpose of this study was to model and analyze hospital to home transition processes of frail older adults in order to identify the challenges within this process. A multi-phase, multi-sited and mixed methods design was utilized, in which, Phase 1 included collecting semi-structured interviews and focus group data, and Phase 2 consisted of six patient/caregiver dyad prospective case studies. This study was conducted in three hospitals in three cities in a single province in Canada. The Functional Resonance Analysis Method (FRAM) was employed to model daily operations of the transition process. The perspectives of both healthcare providers and patients/caregivers were used to build the FRAM model. The transition model was then tested using a customized version of the FRAM. The six patient/caregiver cases were used in the process of testing the FRAM model. The results of building the FRAM model showed that five categories of functions contributed to the transition model, including admission, assessment, synthesis, decision-making, and readmission. The outcomes of using the customized version of the FRAM revealed challenges affecting the transition process including waitlists for geriatric units, team-based care, lack of a discharge planner, financial concerns, and follow-up plans. The findings of this study could assist managers and other decision makers to improve the transition processes of frail older adults by addressing these challenges. The FRAM method employed in this study can be applied widely to identify work practices that are more or less successful, so that procedures and practices can be adapted to nudge healthcare processes towards paths that will yield better outcomes.",

    "abstract": "In this study, we assessed pressure tolerance in 16 healthy participants at the thigh, chest, and pelvic area, using different surfaces (1 cm2, 20 cm2 and different components, used in exoskeleton design), and the effects of different padding materials. Our results showed substantial variability in pressure tolerance among the participants, as well as lower pressure tolerance in females. Regarding the force applied with the exoskeleton components, male participants had higher discomfort threshold (230.3 ± 44.9 N compared to females (116.1 ± 24.6 N) in the chest area. For the applications with 20 cm2 surface, the males also showed higher pain threshold at the thigh (89.3 ± 41.8 N vs. 34.6 ± 27.2 N) and the pelvis (97.6 ± 37.0 N vs. 56.1 ± 29.5 N). All padding materials increased pressure tolerance for 10–38% (p < 0.001), but little differences between materials were observed.",

    "abstract": "The objective of this study was to evaluate and compare the effects of three passive back-support exoskeletons (FLx ErgoSkeleton, V22 ErgoSkeleton, and Laevo V2.5) and patient transfer methods on physical demands in the low back and shoulders during patient transfer. Twenty professional caregivers (17 females and 3 males) performed a series of simulated patient transfer tasks between a wheelchair and a bed with three different patient transfer methods including the squat pivot, stand pivot, and scoot with two directions (wheelchair to bed and vice versa). The passive exoskeletons (FLx ErgoSkeleton, V22 ErgoSkeleton, and Laevo V2.5) significantly affected trunk postures (forward flexion and lateral flexion), shoulder postures (flexion and abduction), hand pull forces, muscle activities of erector spinae and middle deltoid (p-values < 0.01). The muscle activities of the erector spinae were significantly lower (up to 11.2%) with the FLx and V22 ErgoSkeletons compared to no exoskeleton condition (p-values < 0.002). However, the trunk and shoulder flexion angles with the passive exoskeleton use were greater (up to 77.3%) than those without the exoskeletons (p-values < 0.03). The biomechanical benefits and usability varied by passive exoskeleton designs (p-values < 0.01). The lower muscle activities of the erector spinae suggest that the back-support exoskeletons may be a viable intervention to reduce the low back strain during patient transfer tasks. More research would be needed to reduce the adverse effects of back-support exoskeletons on the postures such as increased trunk and shoulder flexions during patient handling.",

    "abstract": "One task of CCTV operation is to decide whether footage shown in videos depicts criminal behaviour, or allows a viewer to predict its occurrence. An increasing prevalence of cameras in the world, means an increase in screens in the control room. This presents a signal-to-noise challenge where the signal (criminal activity) may become more difficult to detect amongst the noise. We used signal detection approaches to understand which factors were associated with decision-making in a CCTV task. When detecting aggressive incidents, higher conscientiousness was associated with making better decisions, with a higher criterion for responding (meaning fewer false-positive responses). However, conscientious individuals tended to be less confident (in multiplex displays), and were slower in responding – which reflects that these individuals require more evidence to make these decisions. Higher trait cognitive anxiety was again associated with making earlier responses, while extraversion was also associated with earlier responding in multiplexed displays. Taken in combination, our results suggest that there is a fine balance between making correct decisions, and making early decisions – and that these need to be considered together in the CCTV task.",

    "year": "2021",
    "doi": "10.1016/j.apergo.2021.103358",
    "abstract": "Introduction Failure-to-identify hunting incidents occur when a hunter, believing they are shooting at an animal, shoots at another human. Anecdotal evidence from the hunting community suggests that heightened arousal or excitement (“buck fever”), liquid intake, food intake, sleepiness and personality factors may be contributory factors to such incidents. Hunters who have shot other people based on failures-to-identify also report observing their hunted quarry for a considerable time before discharging their firearm. Concerning the complexity of hunting, we sought to ascertain if simulation would prove an effective platform for future safety research into this phenomenon. Method We conducted a video-based simulation of a deer hunt during a hunting exhibition show. Participants (N = 60) took part in one of four conditions – two types of scenario (having a good versus bad hunt) and two types of video (clear opportunity to shoot a stag versus clear opportunity to shoot an animal that cannot be identified). We investigated hunting outcomes and physiological arousal during the simulation, as well as personality traits, and self-reports of food, liquid intake and sleepiness. We also measured estimated versus actual time elapsed. Results Pupil dilation, consistent with psychophysiological arousal, occurred when the hunter spotted their first stag, whereas Electrodermal Activity reduced. In the 10 s before shooting, EDA increased substantially. Time also appeared to slow down based on the participants’ estimations of duration. Conclusions The findings corroborate suggestions of physiological arousal in the immediate lead-up to shooting but fall short of direct evidence for “buck fever” contributing to target misidentification. The simulation appeared to provide enough immersion to facilitate future research. Practical application This helps to understand the psychophysiological and temporal considerations of a hunter as they decide to shoot based on the information available to them at the time.",

    "abstract": "Work-related low back disorders are commonly associated with handling tasks. The objective of this study was to determine the combined influence of distance, pace, handled mass and height, on back loading and posture during free box transfer. Kinematics and kinetics of 17 handlers were recorded during a box transfer task between two pallets. Four-way repeated measures ANOVA were conducted on four lift-deposit height conditions (from lift and deposit of 0.16 or 1.16 m), three distances between pallets (1.5, 1.0 and 0.5 m), two handled masses (10 and 20 kg) and two paces (free and faster). The interaction between distance and height on back loading and posture (P < 0.001) showed that increasing distance to more than 1 m is not recommended to avoid unnecessary cumulative loading. The shorter distance of 0.5 m, which generally reduced the most spine loading, may increase it for transfers varying in height. The effect of pace to reduce spine cumulative loading and increase the peak asymmetric loading (P < 0.05) was accentuated by mass, height and distance. The combined factors revealed the importance of tradeoff between peak, cumulative and asymmetric loading.",

    "abstract": "The Ovako Working posture Assessment System (OWAS) is a commonly used observational assessment method for determining the risk of work-related musculoskeletal disorders. OWAS claims to be suitable in the application for untrained persons but there is not enough evidence for this assumption. In this paper, inter-rater (inter-observer) reliability (agreement) is examined down to the level of individual postures and categories. For this purpose, the postures of 20 volunteers have been observed by 3 varying human raters in a laboratory setting and the inter-rater agreement against reference values was determined. A high agreement of over 98 % ( κ = 0.98 ) was found for the postures of the arms but lower agreements were found for posture classification of the legs ( 66 − 97 % , κ = 0.85 ) and the upper body ( 80 − 96 % , κ = 0.85 ) . No significant difference was found between raters with and without intense prior training in physical therapy. Consequently, the results confirm the general reliability of the OWAS method especially for raters with non-specialized background but suggests weaknesses in the reliable detection of a few particular postures.",

    "abstract": "Reducing errors within a healthcare setting remains high on the patient safety research agenda. More consistent performance has been sought by increased development of standardised operating procedures, but they are not always adhered to in practice. Previous studies have identified that a difference exists between the way a task is imagined to be completed, based on standardised protocols and procedures, and how the task is actually completed in reality. This study explores one area of healthcare, community pharmacy, and more specifically the task of dispensing medicines from prescriptions, to identify the gap between how dispensing is imagined to be completed through standardised operating procedures, and how it is actually completed in practice, by using Hierarchical Task Analysis as a framework. Document analysis of standardised operating procedures in 3 community pharmacies was used to produce 3 task analyses, which were compared with 3 task analyses produced from data collected through non-participant observations of the same 3 community pharmacies. Deviations between the two forms of task analyses were presented to community pharmacists in focus group discussions and it was found staff may deviate from standardised protocols because of various reasons, including: efficiency; availability of resources; thoroughness; and delegating safeguards. Potential implications for the work system include the benefit of greater collaboration between procedure writers and frontline workers, and the introduction of more flexible procedures, that allow the risks of any adaptions to be clearly realised. Further work must establish whether pharmacists recognise the safety implications of these gaps between work as imagined, and work as done, and initiatives should be established to ensure patient safety is not compromised due to these differences.",

This study examined the effects of body posture, interaction distance and target size on freehand interaction with a large display. Participants performed pointing and dragging tasks by freehand interaction with a large display under sitting and standing postures and at different interaction distances. Targets in both small and large sizes were examined. Results showed that interaction distance yielded a significant effect on error rate, but the effect differed by task type. Little measurable difference was found in interaction performance, perceived usability and workload between sitting and standing postures. There were significant interaction effects between posture and interaction distance on perceived workload. Larger target size led to higher efficiency and accuracy in pointing tasks, but reduced accuracy in dragging tasks. This study provided implications that are likely to improve the design and deployment of large display-based freehand interaction techniques.",

    "abstract": "Purpose To investigate the influence of aerobic capacity, muscle strength, and body composition on performance and metabolic demands of men wearing personal protective equipment (PPE). Methods 45 men were assigned to one of four groups which significantly differed in upright pull isometric strength (MVC ≤ 1325 N or ≥ 1531 N) and maximum oxygen uptake (VO2max ≤ 51.9 mL min−1·kg−1 or ≥ 56.0 mL min−1·kg−1): endurance-trained (low MVC, high VO2max), strength-trained (high MVC, low VO2max), endurance- and strength-trained (high MVC, high VO2max), and untrained (low MVC, low VO2max). Each participant underwent two test series consisting of a repeated 10 m dummy drag and a graded exercise test wearing either sportswear or PPE of a German riot police unit weighing 20.9 kg (statistics: two-way repeated measures ANOVA, stepwise multiple linear regressions). Results With PPE, dummy drag and running performance were impaired by 14 ± 9% and 58 ± 7%. Groups with high MVC dragged the dummy significantly faster than groups with low MVC (17.5 ± 1.8 s/17.6 ± 1.4 s vs. 23.4 ± 5.6 s/22.3 ± 3.5 s). Running distance was significantly higher in groups with high VO2max (4.5 ± 0.8 km/4.4 ± 0.7 km vs. 3.1 ± 0.5 km/2.8 ± 0.5 km). Body composition variables partially correlated with performance (R ranging from −0.70 to 0.41), but were not significant predictors of the regression models in PPE. Conclusions Individuals who showed a certain degree of aerobic endurance, as well as muscle strength, performed consistently well during the test series. Therefore, none of these variables should be trained in isolation but optimized in combination to be capable in a variety of operational tasks.",

    "abstract": "There is sparse research directly investigating the effects of trust manipulations in human-human and human-robot interactions. Moreover, studies on human-human versus human-robot trust have leveraged unusual or low vulnerability contexts to investigate such effects and have focused mostly on robot performance. In the present research, we seek to remedy these limitations and compare trust in human-human versus human-robot collaborations in an augmented and adapted version of the Trust Game. We used a mixed factorial design to examine the effects of trust and trust violations on human-human and human-robot interactions over time with an emphasis on anthropomorphic robots in a social context. We found consistent and significant effects of partner behavior. Specifically, partner distrust behaviors led to participants’ lower levels of trustworthiness perceptions, trust intentions, and trust behaviors over time compared to partner trust behaviors. We found no significant effect of partnering with a human versus an anthropomorphic robot over time across the three dependent variables, supporting the computers as social actors (CASA; Nass and Moon, 2000) paradigm. This study demonstrated that there may be instances where the effects of trust violations from an anthropomorphized robot partner are not meaningfully different from those of a human partner in a social context.",

    "abstract": "This study evaluated whole body vibration (WBV), non-driving task performance, muscle activity, and self-reported discomfort and motion sickness between different seat suspension systems in a simulated vehicle environment. In a repeated-measures laboratory experiment where field-measured 6-degree-of-freedom (6-DOF) passenger vehicle vibration was replicated on a 6-DOF motion platform, we measured WBV, non-driving task (pointing, typing, web-browsing, and reading) performance, low back (erector spinae), shoulders (trapezius) and neck (splenius capitis and sternocleido-mastoid) muscle activity, and self-reported discomfort and motion sickness from three different seats: a vertical (z-axis) active suspension, multi-axial active suspension [vertical (z-axis) + lateral (y-axis)], and a static suspension-less seat (current seat type in all passenger cars). Both the vertical and multi-axial active suspension seats significantly reduced the vertical WBV exposure (p < 0.0001). However, no significant differences were found in non-driving task performance (p > 0.30), muscle activity (p > 0.22), self-reported discomfort (p > 0.07), and motion sickness (p = 0.53) across three different seats. These findings indicate that the active suspension seats may have potential to future reduce the vertical and total WBV exposures, respectively. However, none of the suspension seats demonstrate any significant benefits on the non-driving task performance, muscle activity, self-reported discomfort and motion sickness measures in a simulated vehicle environment.",

Participant, load and task characteristics and a summary of key findings were extracted. Due to heterogeneity in the reviewed studies, analysis was restricted to qualitative synthesis. There were limited effects on spatio-temporal variables but consistently reported increased trunk, hip and knee flexion and increased hip and knee extension moments. Muscle activation of lower limb and trunk muscles were also increased with loads. However, there were some conflicting findings for most parameters reviewed and apart from spatio-temporal parameters the findings of this review were in line with previous reviews of combined military and civilian populations.",

A convergent parallel mixed-methods design, comprising a post-usage questionnaire survey and focus groups, was used for data collection. A number of 57 community-dwelling cognitively impaired older people in Hong Kong completed an eight-week, home-based cognitive training using tablets delivered by older volunteers. The acceptance of the tablet usage for cognitive training was evaluated using questionnaire survey. Focus groups were conducted with participants, volunteers, and social workers to explore their experiences of tablet usage for cognitive training. Results indicated that attitudes toward tablets and facilitating conditions were predictors of intention to use tablets at the individual level. Tablets were perceived as beneficial on cognition, enjoyment, learning, social relationships, and communication. Contextual level factors that can encourage tablets usage include capacity building, empowerment, supports from the organization, and trust.",

Muscle activity, ground reaction force, posture, and rating of perceived exertion were significantly affected by task method. Erector Spinae activity was reduced in boosting and turning away tasks with the slide sheet. Shoulder elevation, torso angle, and normalized vertical ground reaction force were also reduced with the slide sheet during boosting. The turn towards task was generally not improved with the slide sheet. Overall, using a slide sheet provided biomechanical benefits to individual caregivers performing two common patient handling tasks: boosting and turning patient away from caregiver.",

    "abstract": "The ubiquity of EHRs in healthcare means that small EHR inefficiencies can have a major impact on clinician workload. We conducted a sequential explanatory mixed methods study to: 1) identify EHR-associated workload and usability effects for clinicians following an EHR change over time, 2) determine workload and usability differences for providers (MD and Advance Practice Nurses) versus nurses (RNs and MAs), 3) determine if usability predicts workload, 4) identify potential sources of EHR design flaws. Workload (NASA-Task Load Index) and usability (System Usability Scale) measures were administered pre, 6–8 month and 30–32 months post-implementation. We found significant increase in perceived workload post-implementation that persisted for 2.5 years (p < .001). The workload increase was associated with usability ratings, which in turn may relate to EHR interface design violations identified by a heuristic evaluation. Our findings suggest further innovation and attention to interface design flaws are needed to improve EHR usability and reduce clinician workload.",

    "abstract": "Carpal Tunnel Syndrome (CTS) is one of the most frequently occurring musculoskeletal disorders of the upper limbs. Strategies for preventing CTS in the workplace include interventions such as ergonomics, education, exercise, physical therapy, and occupational health. The purpose of this study was to provide a general overview based on the review of scientific literature regarding strategies used for preventing CTS in working populations. From September to October 2018, the MEDLINE, PUBMED, EMBASE and SCOPUS (1990 to December 2017) databases were searched for evidence. The risk of bias assessment in the selected papers was evaluated using the criteria recommended by The Cochrane Handbook and the methodological quality of the included studies was evaluated using Standard Quality Assessment Criteria for Evaluating Primary Research Papers from a Variety of Fields. A total of 11 studies were included in the present review. A total of 1,061 subjects participated in the studies. The quality of the included studies was limited in three studies, appropriate in three studies, good in three studies, and strong in two studies. The overall results suggest a mixed level of evidence of the effect of applying strategies for preventing CTS in the workplace. The bias assessment was primarily due to incomplete result data, selective reporting of results, and blinding. In this review, interventions focused on the modification or change of accessories (keyboard, mouse, wrist rest, and the overall workstation), education in ergonomics, exercise, and physical therapies, among others, were analyzed. The findings of this review show different possibilities when choosing an intervention strategy for the workplace. However, it was challenging to analyze each of the papers owing to the heterogeneity of the studies included.",

    "doi": "10.1016/j.apergo.2021.103369",
    "abstract": "Within the last decade, Para sport has experienced increased growth, global popularity, and scientific research. Likewise, there is increasing application of systems ergonomics methods to optimise sports performance. Despite this, few studies have attempted to analyse Para sport as a complex system. The aim of this study was to apply a systems ergonomics framework to redesign a current Para sport system via a multi staged approach. The Cognitive Work Analysis framework was used to model and redesign the Para sport system, via the insertion of design interventions. The findings offer insights into the complexity of the Para sport system via the multiple interacting factors that influence the performance of the system. In addition, the design interventions had substantial influence on the Para sport system by creating multiple new processes, functions, measures, and purposes, and enhanced multiple components of the existing system. This study provides a unique contribution to ergonomic science and extends system ergonomics theory and methods in sport. This study has practical implications for policy development by providing a template that can be used by others wanting to optimise able-bodied sport, Para sport, and non-sport systems.",

    "abstract": "Helicopter emergency medical service search and rescue (HEMS SAR) paramedics perform physically demanding winch rescues. Rescue organisations require valid physical employment standards (PES) to ensure personnel can adequately perform duties. There are no studies describing validated PES for HEMS SAR. We convened a subject matter expert (SME) focus group to review historical case data and generate task descriptions for land and water winch rescue as the basis for development of task simulations to assess physiological workload. Sixteen helicopter rescue paramedics with a mean age of 47 (range, 36–52) years and 8 (2–20) years’ experience in helicopter rescue participated in a SME focus group. When provided with data from historical cases, SMEs achieved consensus (≥80%) when generating descriptions of winch rescue. This method may be useful to develop simulations for assessment of physiological demands of winch rescue and similar tasks, and to enhance validity and reliability of PES for rescue organisations.",

Exposure to non-neutral postures and high movement speeds associated with MSDs among manufacturing workers may depend on the extent of the variability in the work tasks performed (i.e., predominantly “cyclic” versus “non-cyclic” work). The objectives of this study were to (i) compare mean levels of full-shift exposure summary metrics based on both posture and movement speed between manufacturing workers performing predominantly cyclic (n = 18) and non-cyclic (n = 17) tasks, and (ii) explore patterns of between- and within-worker exposure variance and between-minute (within-shift) exposure level and variation within each group. Inertial sensors were used to measure exposures for up to 15 full shifts per participant. Results indicated (i) substantially higher upper arm and trunk movement speeds among workers performing predominantly cyclic tasks relative to workers performing non-cyclic tasks despite similar postures, and (ii) greater exposure variability both between and within workers in the non-cyclic group.",

    "abstract": "The use of inertial measurement units (IMUs) for monitoring and classifying physical activities has received substantial attention in recent years, both in occupational and non-occupational contexts. However, a “user-friendly” approach is needed to promote this approach to quantify physical demands in actual workplaces. We explored the use of a single IMU for extracting information about different manual material handling (MMH) tasks (i.e., specific type of task performed, and associated duration and frequency), using a bidirectional long short-term memory network for classification. Classification performance using single IMUs placed on several body parts was compared with performance using multiple IMU configurations (2, 3, and 17 IMUs). Overall, the use of a single sensor led to satisfactory results (e.g., median accuracy >97%) in classifying MMH tasks and estimating task duration and frequency. Limited benefits were obtained using additional sensors, and several sensor locations yielded similar outcomes. Classification performance, though, was relatively inferior for push/pull vs. other tasks.",

    "abstract": "Taillight shape in a vehicle provides an essential lighting signal that enables the vehicle to be seen from the rear at night, thereby preventing rear-end crashes. This study aims to investigate the effects of taillight shape on vehicle conspicuity, and proposes ergonomic taillight shape solutions to vehicle designers and manufacturers. Two complementary experiments were conducted to examine three types of taillight shapes at three design levels. The first experiment was designed to investigate the detection speed of a driver and the fixation duration and fixation counts on leading vehicles with different taillight shapes, based on an eye-tracking methodology. The second experiment was designed to investigate the dynamic visual searching performance of a trailing driver for leading vehicles with different taillight shapes, based on a visual search task. The experimental results indicated that a long line-shaped taillight (striplight) was the optimal ergonomic solution for enhancing vehicle conspicuity. Vehicles with an enclosed contour-shaped taillight were more salient than those with an open contour-shaped taillight. Moreover, the experience and gender of the driver and the vehicle–observer distance were found to be closely related to vehicle conspicuity, and therefore, must be considered by vehicle designers when applying a specific taillight shape design. This study provides insights into the taillight shape design that not only aid vehicle designers or manufacturers in enhancing vehicle safety but also enable potential vehicle buyers to choose a safe lighting system.",

    "abstract": "Through music, film composers attempt to affect the audience's emotions and visual attention; however, little empirical evidence exists characterizing the mechanisms whereby music affects viewers. We conducted a mixed-design experiment with 60 participants to explore the effect of music on viewers' visual attention and affective responses to a film. Music led to quicker first fixations on film objects and supplied emotional content, increasing positive sentiment for the film's story. However, music did not influence viewers' attitudes to filmed events. Within this context, music has limited impact on attitudes toward filmed events but can accentuate the saliency of film objects and supply emotional information altering viewers' sentiment towards the film. Understanding the mechanisms of music's physiological and behavioral effects can inform content delivery strategies. This study offers insights for composition and production of musical soundtracks for feature-length films, advertising videos, educational videos, and video games.",

    "abstract": "The research represents one of the first major qualitative studies to subjectively investigate fatigue amongst city bus drivers. Funded by TfL (grant no. 94050), the study considers the perspectives of both the bus drivers themselves and their managers. It explores opinion specifically in relation to how fatigue influences or is influenced by bus driving, and how this is managed. Data was collected from focus groups with bus drivers (n = 65 drivers) and one-to-one interviews with bus driver managers (n = 11). Fatigue was seen to be a problem, with all drivers having experienced for themselves the feeling of sleepiness whilst driving the bus, or knowing about it in others. The managers agreed that fatigue amongst drivers is evident, seeing it particularly as a contributor to serious incidents. Fatigue and sleepiness are not discussed between drivers as a general rule and they do not feel comfortable reporting instances of fatigue for fear of being disciplined. Managers would encourage drivers to report these issues and therefore hoped to create a more open culture. Factors identified as contributors to fatigue included: working overtime, having insufficient sleep, spending time with family, other non-work commitments, shift schedules, and work pressure.",

    "abstract": "Minimal footwear has become more ubiquitous; however, it may increase slip severity. This study specifically examined the slipping kinematics of flip-flop sandals. Invoked slips from standing were evaluated in dry and wet tile, and a unique wet footbed + wet tile condition, with 40, 50, and 60% bodyweight (BW) committed to the slipping foot. Water did not alter peak slip velocity (PV) at 40% BW, but PV increased with greater slip-foot force on wet tile by ~1 m/s. Interestingly, when floor-contact was lost during the slip, the flip-flops could come off the heel. This decoupling occurred most often when both the tile and footbed were either dry or wet. Given that both decoupling and greater PV were observed on wet tile, slipping in flip-flops under wet conditions may have more serious consequences. The results highlight that slips may occur at both the foot—flip-flop, and flip-flop—tile interfaces.",

Participants were randomized into four groups with exposure to either the ISA, Motion-symbol, Universal-Design-symbol, or all-symbols. The results showed that different symbols were associated with different patterns of perceived symbolic meanings. Exposure to the Universal-Design-symbol, which emphasizes equality (but not the Motion-symbol, which emphasizes autonomy), was significantly and indirectly associated with relatively lower stereotypes toward wheelchair users (and perceived less inclusive social climate) through associating the Universal-Design-symbol with relatively lower perceived symbolic meanings of “Passive” and “Labeling” (and “Passive”) compared to exposure to the ISA. Recommendations for a contextual-dependent replacement of symbol, the methodology of implicit association tests, and the usage of symbols of access in cartography were discussed.",

A conceptual model of the takeover process is proposed by dividing this process into motor and mental reactions. A laboratory experiment was conducted to evaluate the effects of each NDRT attribute on the corresponding stage of the process of taking over control. A prediction model was developed using the results of multiple linear regression analysis. Additionally, a validation experiment with nine NDRTs and a baseline condition was conducted to determine the extent to which the developed model explains the takeover time for each NDRT condition. The results showed that the timing aspects of the transition of control in HAD largely consist of participant motor reactions that are affected by the physical attributes of NDRTs.",

The aim of this study was to quantify the postural demand, workload, and discomfort experienced by vascular surgeons and to identify procedural factors that influence surgical workload. Both objective (wearable posture sensors) and subjective (surveys) assessment tools were used to evaluate intraoperative workload during 47 vascular surgery procedures. Results demonstrate unfavorable neck and low back postures as well as high pain scores for those body segments. Additionally, workload from subjective surveys increased significantly as a function of operative duration, and mental workload was high across all procedure types. Neck postural risk exposure and physical demand were among the variables that increased with surgical duration, procedure type, and loupes used by the surgeons. Correlations among postural angles and pain scores showed consistency between the objective assessment and the subjective surveys for neck and trunk. The authors believe that the results of this study highlight the need for developing mitigating measures such as ergonomic interventions for vascular surgery.",

    "abstract": "This study investigated the effects of simulating self-motion via a head-mounted display (HMD) on standing postural sway and spatial presence. Standing HMD users viewed simulated oscillatory self-motion in depth. On a particular trial, this naso-occipital visual oscillation had one of four different amplitudes (either 4, 8, 12 or 16 m peak-to-peak) and one of four different frequencies (either 0.125, 0.25, 0.5 or 1 Hz). We found that simulated high amplitude self-oscillation (approximately 16 m peak-to-peak) at either 0.25 Hz or 0.5 Hz: 1) generated the strongest effects on postural sway; and 2) made participants feel more spatially present in the virtual environment. Our findings provide insight into the parameters of simulated self-motion that generate the strongest postural responses within virtual environments. These postural constraints have valuable implications for improving our understanding of sensory processes underlying the ergonomic experience of virtual environments simulated using HMDs.",

    "abstract": "Falls during stair descent pose a major health concern. A stronger understanding of recovery from balance loss during stair descent is needed to guide fall prevention strategies and environmental design. We characterized balance recovery strategies, trunk and center-of-mass (COM) kinematics, and handrail use following unexpected forward balance loss during stair descent, and the effect of perturbation magnitude on these outcomes. Eighteen young adults experienced a rapid platform translation during stair descent to disrupt balance. Deception was used to reduce anticipation. All participants used compensatory stepping to recover balance, and most applied forces to the handrail in multiple directions. Higher perturbation magnitude resulted in higher COM velocity and handrail forces, more frequent incomplete steps, and quicker step contact time. Our findings provide a foundation for understanding balance recovery on stairs. The findings emphasize the importance of designing stairways that enable compensatory stepping, and handrails that permit adequate force generation in multiple directions to facilitate balance recovery on stairs.",

    "abstract": "Various researchers have proposed pupillometric indicators to assess a person's cognitive strain. However, to distinguish the variation of pupil light response from psychosensory pupil response in experimental field conditions is a challenge. The Index of Cognitive Activity (ICA) addresses this problem by wavelet separation. This research investigates the ICA's sensitivity for multiple level task-evoked cognitive activity and visual influences concerning informational work tasks. Objective and subjective measures assessed cognitive strain of participants (N = 22) during various tasks. In a first experiment, mental arithmetic tasks were used to induce different levels of cognitive activity. In a second experiment, influences of screen polarity and presentation of information were investigated (N = 18). The results indicate that eye metrics are rarely sensitive to slight variations in task difficulty. Moreover, the ICA is likely to be sensitive towards constant screen illumination and shows tendencies regarding changes in displayed information. Possible ramifications for the objective assessment of cognitive strain are discussed.",

    "abstract": "Chronotype refers to individual differences in the timing of circadian sleep-wake cycles and subjective alertness throughout the day. It is a potential factor influencing people's driving behaviour, but no research has explored the mechanisms underlying this topic. The current study aimed to explore the relationship between morningness-eveningness preferences and driving behaviour and the mediating effect of visual search between them. Thirty-eight drivers were selected to participate in this study based on their chronotype. They were divided into morning-type and evening-type groups by their score on the reduced Morningness-Eveningness Questionnaire (rMEQ). Both groups completed a visual search task and a simulated driving task in a morning session and an evening session. The results showed that morningness-eveningness preferences had synchronous effects on basic driving performance; specifically, morning-type drivers showed better driving behaviour in the morning than in the evening, and evening-type drivers showed the opposite trend. Furthermore, visual search abilities showed a mediating effect between morningness-eveningness preference and driving performance. The mechanisms underlying these results are discussed. Related results and data could aid with schedule arrangements for professional drivers.",

PsycINFO, Web of Science, and PubMed databases were utilized, along with a hand search. PRISMA and MMAT guidelines were used for reporting and quality appraisal. Out of 1,001 articles, 20 were eligible. Identified categories included hybrid and integrated environments, technological ambiance, and information technologies. Technology integration has implications for direct patient care, efficiency, throughput, patient safety, teamwork, communication, and the perception of care. The facilitators for and barriers to technology integration included layout design, equipment positioning, and decluttering. The physical environment can improve the impact of technology on factors such as patient safety and efficiency.",

    "doi": "10.1016/j.apergo.2020.103349",
    "abstract": "Archived video footage from a previous task analysis study where children attempted to open prescription vials outfitted with 42 mm (diameter) push and turn closures was reviewed and grip postures were characterized based on a grip taxonomy presented by Rowson & Yoxall which investigated adult grips (2011). Video review was conducted to identify the types of grip postures children aged 3–5 years utilized when attempting to open continuous thread polypropylene vials outfitted with push and turn, child-resistant closures and compared with grip postures identified with the adults. Children tended to utilize only 3 grip postures (spherical, cylindrical, and pronated cylindrical grips), while adults utilized seven different postures. If children utilize a more limited set of grip postures when opening child resistant closures than their adult counterparts, this difference could be exploited when designing child resistant packaging systems. That said, our study utilized a limited number of CRC designs and confounds existed between the package sizes the children in the archived video footage attempted to open and those that served as the point of comparison which identified grip postures utilized by adults. As such, further investigation is needed across a range of package diameters. Potential implications for child-resistant packaging design are discussed.",

    "doi": "10.1016/j.apergo.2020.103338",
    "abstract": "In order to be able to develop a hammer drill with which the user can work as ergonomically and productively as possible, the relevant influencing factors must be known. In addition to the unknown influence of the drilling direction, there is a lack of understanding of the relations between user forces, human fatigue, and productivity. To analyze these relations, an experiment was carried out with 15 professional users. First, the influence of feed force, drilling direction, and drill bit on the rate of penetration was examined. Taking into account the rate of penetration and human fatigue, it was then investigated which of the three feed forces produces the highest productivity. Furthermore, the lateral forces applied by the participants during the drilling process were analyzed. Based on the study, it was found that the drilling direction (p < .001, r = −0.198) and the drill bit type (p < .041, r = −0.16) have a significant influence on the rate of penetration. Moreover, it was found that the rate of penetration tends to increase with higher feed forces, however, the theoretical cumulative drilling meters decrease when taking user fatigue into account. Finally, the experiment showed that the participating professionals applied lateral forces (Mdn = 16.7 N) of 13% to the feed force when working with a hammer drill. On the basis of this knowledge, investigations can be done to analyze the influences of lateral forces on the drilling process. The findings help drill and hammer drill manufacturers in testing and development processes.

The aim of the study was to elucidate staff experiences of providing home- and health-care to older people living in ordinary housing. This study was part of a larger project investigating the relation between home design and conditions for care in ordinary housing. The data were gathered through focus group interviews with staff in home- and health-care. Three main themes were found according to staff experiences of particular rooms’ sizes and proportions, spatial configurations, and aspects to consider when designing new housing. This study contributes important knowledge about essential features of the physical environment for staff providing home- and health-care for older people in their own homes and to aid the development of functionally sustainable housing to minimise injuries to staff.",

    "abstract": "Objective The railway industry in Indonesia has grown substantially in the past five years, with greater network and tracks length that will double in 2030. There has been a growing concern, however, that fatigue among front-line personnel have not been addressed satisfactorily. This study aimed at evaluating the degree of fatigue among passenger train drivers and suggested practical recommendations to the Indonesian Railway Company. Method A total of 32 train drivers (driving for about 4 h during the morning or afternoon shifts) agreed to participate in the study. Subjective and objective measures of fatigue (and sleepiness) were obtained prior to, during, and immediately following the end of a duty. Fatigue and driving performance were also determined based on (off-line) analysis of continuous video recordings of the drivers performing the duty. Results Fatigue generally increased as a function of time and, for some, 2 h of driving was sufficient in inducing substantial level of fatigue increase. Unlike the morning shift, the afternoon shift was characterized with increased undue fatigue and unacceptable level of performance decrements. Conclusion In general, fatigue was not found among train drivers working the morning shift. For these drivers, however, there were a couple of individuals with excessive levels of fatigue. The effects of fatigue were more apparent for the afternoon shift. This is possibly due to the degraded sleep quality as a result of split rest periods obtained prior to the duty. It is suggested in this study that the company pay a much closer attention to the work-sleep schedules, and to improve sleep quality by redesigning better sleeping arrangements.",

    "abstract": "Manual material handling is common in supermarkets and may be a contributing factor to the high prevalence of work-related musculoskeletal disorders, particularly to the lower back. This cross-sectional study applied state-of-the-art musculoskeletal models driven by kinematic data obtained in two supermarkets to estimate joint reaction forces in the knees, shoulders and lumbar spine under dynamic lifting conditions. Based on 1479 lifts from 15 workers, 8 tasks for which the compression or shear forces in the L5-S1 joint exceeded well-known biomechanical tolerance limits were identified. High shoulder forces were associated with lifting relatively heavy merchandise to high shelves, while the weight of the handled merchandise was the main predictor of high knee forces. The study addressed well-known limitations associated with traditional lifting analysis tools and was the first to present a detailed analysis of the biomechanical loads during manual material handling tasks in the supermarket sector based on field measurements.",

    "abstract": "Fatigue arising from excessive work demands is a known safety challenge in hospital nurses. This study aimed to determine which measures of work demands during nursing work are most predictive of hospital nurse fatigue levels at the end of the work shift. Measures of work demands of registered nurses from two hospital units in the United States were collected from organizational data sources, wearable sensors, and questionnaires. Fatigue levels were measured at the start and end of each shift using the Brief Fatigue Inventory. Multilevel linear regression analysis was used to predict end of shift fatigue based on work demand variables. The best fit model included multiple variables from organizational data sources and a physical activity variable measured by a wearable sensor. Organizational data can be used to create dynamic measures of work demands as they occur and predict end of shift fatigue levels in hospital nurses.",

    "abstract": "Motion sickness (MS) is known to be a potentially limiting factor for future self-driving vehicles – specifically in regards to occupant comfort and well-being. With this as a consideration comes the desire to accurately measure, track and even predict MS state in real-time. Previous research has considered physiological measurements to measure MS state, although, this is mainly measured after an MS exposure and not throughout exposure(s) to a MS task. A unique contribution of this paper is in the real-time tracking of subjective MS alongside real-time physiological measurements of Electrodermal Activity (EDA) and skin temperature. Data was collected in both simulator-based (controlled) and on-road (naturalistic) studies. 40 participants provided at total of 61 data sets, providing 1603 min of motion sickness data for analysis. This study is in agreement that these measures are related to MS but evidenced a total lack of reliability for these measures at an individual level for both simulator and on-road experimentation. It is likely that other factors, such as environment and emotional state are more impactful on these physiological measures than MS itself. At a cohort level, the applicability of physiological measures is not considered useful for measuring MS accurately or reliably in real-time. Recommendations for further research include a mixed-measures approach to capture other data types (such as subject activity) and to remove contamination of physiological measures from environmental changes.",

This study investigated the effects of sitting and standing workstations on the physical workload and cognitive performance under variable cognitive demand conditions. Fifteen participants visited two times for testing sitting and standing workstations, and were asked to play two difficulty levels of Tetris game for 40 min while kinematic variables, CoP regularity, CoP SD, and cognitive performances were captured every 5 min. Results revealed a more neural posture in standing than in sitting, but using the standing workstation degraded attention and executive function. The CoP SD was 7 times greater in standing, but the CoP regularity was 1/4 in sitting, denoting greater attentional investment while engaged at the standing workstation.",

    "abstract": "Automated vehicles are expected to enhance driving safety and comfort. In order to fulfil these expectations, they have to be widely accepted and used. Implementing an acceptable driving style is therefore a must. Previous research on automated vehicle acceptance has largely concentrated on the effects of driving dynamics. This study takes a different approach and focuses on the effects of the driving decisions. To assess the effects of driving decisions on acceptance, an online experimental study was conducted in China, Germany, Japan and the US. Four overtaking scenarios, in which the automated vehicle took a decision, were presented as short texts. The situations differed with regard to the action (overtaking vs. stay in lane) and potential consequence (high or low hindrance of another driver). Participants then rated their acceptance. The results indicate that acceptance is dependent on the driving decisions and is further influenced by cultural background. Chinese drivers show high acceptance to the decisions and there were no significant differences between the presented scenarios. In the US and Germany, decisions leading to high hindrance of others are rejected, whereas in cases of low hindrance, overtaking is preferred. Japanese participants reject decisions, which lead to hindrance of others.",

Results of the analysis of the EMG data revealed that the SHORT condition did not show increased EMG activity, while LONG [21%] and MEDIUM [10%] did (p < 0.05), providing objective data supporting the guidance of short, frequent breaks to alleviate fatigue.",

Subjects were exposed to a ship deck vision scene under simulated Degree 5 or 3 sea condition using a head-mounted virtual reality display with or without GVS. Virtual ship motion at Degree 5 induced significant cybersickness with symptom profile: nausea syndrome > central (headache and dizziness) > peripheral (cold sweating) > increased salivation. During a single session of virtual ship motion exposure, GVS aggravated balance disturbance but did not affect most cybersickness symptoms except cold sweating. Repeated exposure induced cybersickness habituation which was delayed by GVS, while the temporal change of balance disturbance was unaffected. These results suggested that vestibular inputs play different roles in cybersickness and balance disturbance during virtual reality exposure. GVS might not serve as a potential countermeasure against cybersickness induced by virtual ship motion.",

    "abstract": "This paper presents the results of an extensive survey concerning the experience of safety footwear end-users. Safety footwear has been in widespread use across many industries worldwide since the 1970s, and has become an essential part of industrial Personal Protective Equipment. The number of women entering predominantly male industrial environments, and requiring safety footwear is rising, and this is accompanied by anecdotal reports of ill-fitting and uncomfortable footwear. This research proactively compares the opinions of women and men regarding their experience of safety footwear. A systematically designed survey aims to substantiate previously anecdotal knowledge around safety footwear, including key drivers for end-user purchases, wear habits and comfort issues (establishing any differences between women and men). Chi-squared testing was used to assess statistical significance and ensure robustness of findings. The responses and resulting analysis confirmed that comfort and fit were key drivers for all end users; women and men have different wear habits (women wear their safety footwear less frequently and for shorter periods of time than men – likely due to the reported comfort issues); a significant proportion of women (60%) found their safety footwear less comfortable than their regular footwear, however, 45% of men also reported the same, which has not been reported anecdotally. In general, the users of safety footwear accepted a level of discomfort in at least one area of the foot before deeming footwear ‘uncomfortable’. The significant analysis performed on the captured data has, to the authors knowledge, never before been undertaken for this breadth of industry, age and gender with 632 responses received. This makes it the largest study of this field to date.",

    "abstract": "Work-related musculoskeletal disorders are highly prevalent in the supermarket sector with manual material handling being one of the most commonly identified occupational risk factors. This cross-sectional study applied inertial motion capture and electromyography (EMG) to measure full-body kinematics and muscle activity of trapezius descendens and erector spinae longissimus during 50 manual material handling tasks performed by 17 workers in two supermarkets. The handling of bread and cucumbers to high shelf heights showed the highest trapezius muscle activity (from 47% to 59% peak normalized EMG), while the handling of bananas as well as lifting milk, bread and cucumbers from low to high positions showed the highest erector spinae activity (from 59% to 71%). Twenty-two tasks involved flexing the shoulders and trunk more than 90° and 50°, respectively. Based on these results, several manual handling practices in supermarkets should be reconsidered to reduce the physical work demands.",

    "abstract": "Public transport systems are vital services in urban environments. The design of these complex socio-technical systems is continuously evolving to accommodate larger populations, and their adaptation is essential in supporting the successful and sustainable development of cities and regions. An essential part of this adaptation includes working to increase passenger safety and to minimise their risk of injury. With this focus, key objectives of the current study were to identify the causes of slip, trip and fall (STF) incidents attributable to the rail user and to train and station characteristics. An investigation of historical STF records of 1247 train and station incidents in two Australian jurisdictions was conducted. Various contributing factors to STF events were identified, including locations such as stairs, ramps, escalators, the train's entry and exit step, doorway areas, and passenger running or rushing. A mixed-method field study was then conducted at three train stations and on trains. To further investigate the contributing factors, participants (N = 40) wore an eye tracker as they navigated the stations and trains. The research illustrates that their continuous search for information, and a disconnect between the information needed and the information provided, might be a cause of passenger distraction and an increase in their risky behaviour. Therefore, we suggest that improvements in information design to reduce the high visual workload for passengers might also reduce the incidence of STFs.",

    "abstract": "Office workers can spend significant periods of time being stationary whilst at work, with potentially serious health consequences. The development of effective health interventions could be aided by a greater understanding of the location and environmental context in which this stationary behaviour occurs. Real time location systems (RTLS) potentially offer the opportunity to gather this much needed information, but they have not been extensively trialled in office workplaces, nor rigorously compared against more familiar devices such as accelerometers. The aim of this paper was to determine whether an RTLS can measure and spatially locate the non-stationary and stationary behaviours of adults working in an office work environment. Data collected from a series of comparison studies undertaken in a commercial office building suggests that RTLS can measure the velocity at which people are moving and locate them, when stationary, with an accuracy of 0.668 m (SD 0.389). This opens up significant opportunities to further understand how people move within buildings, the indoor physical environmental influences on that movement, and the development of effective interventions to help people to move more whilst at work.",

    "abstract": "There is limited evidence on the efficacy of insole materials to reduce plantar pressure during regular walking and loaded walking. In-shoe plantar pressures and subjective footwear comfort were recorded in twenty healthy participants at a self-selected treadmill walking speed in six conditions: two commercial insoles or no insole, and with or without carrying a load in a backpack. A single-material insole, comprised of polyurethane, had reduced density and compressive stiffness compared to a dual-material insole with added viscoelastic material in rearfoot and forefoot regions. Load carriage increased peak pressure across the foot. Both insoles reduced plantar pressure in the rearfoot. Yet, the softer single-material insole also attenuated forefoot pressure and loaded walking did not appear to cause bottoming-out of the polyurethane. Plantar pressure changes did not affect perceived footwear comfort. The softer single-material insole was more effective in reducing plantar pressure, further research would confirm if this influences injury prevalence.",

    "abstract": "Touchscreen has gained increasing popularity. However, little is known about touchscreen use in vibration environments. This study aimed to examine the effects of control-to-display gain (GAIN) and operation precision requirement on touchscreen operations in varied vibration environments. Twenty participants attended an experiment where they were instructed to perform three types of basic touchscreen operation tasks in static, low vibration, and high vibration environments, respectively. Five GAINs (0.75, 1, 2, 3 and 4) and three operation precision requirements (90%, 95%, and 99%) were examined. The results indicated that vibration exerted adverse effects on task performance, and increased perceived workload, perceived task difficulty and discomfort. Task completion time showed a U-shaped curve as GAIN increased. Lowering operation precision requirement improved task performance and reduced perceived workload, especially in vibration environments and at larger GAINs. The findings provide practical implications on the design of usable touchscreen interfaces in vibration environments.",

    "doi": "10.1016/j.apergo.2020.103174",
    "abstract": "This paper investigates whether spring-foam technology in an aircraft seat-pan can reduce weight and at the same time provide equal or better comfort. Firstly, through literature studies and using an iterative design process a prototype seat-pan was designed and developed using spring-foam technology. The (dis)comfort of this seat was compared with a standard aircraft seat-pan. Twenty two participants were asked to sit in each seat for 90 min, completing a questionnaire every 15 min. At the end of each seating session pressure map recordings were made of the seat-pans. The results showed that the prototype seat-pan has on average a significantly higher comfort for the first 30 min and at a 60 min recording than the standard seat-pan. The discomfort and long term comfort were not significantly influenced. The pressure distribution on the prototype seat-pan was significantly closer to an ideal pressure distribution than a conventional seat-pan. In addition, the prototype seat-pan had a significantly larger contact area and lower average pressure. The seat-cushion weighs 20% less than the conventional seat-cushion. The study indicates that a seat-pan design using spring-foam technology can be lighter and more comfortable than conventional foam cushion materials. It is recommended to optimize the prototype seat further and conduct long term (dis)comfort studies with a broader variation in subjects’ age.",

    "abstract": "This study was designed to validate a short-duration sustained visual search task for the assessment of sustained attention in process control environments. The task consists of 10 short dynamic scenarios, which require participants (N = 121) to monitor simulated operating power transmission interfaces, and identify system faults. A vigilance decrement was demonstrated throughout the sustained visual search task, as evident in increased response latencies and decreased accuracy over time. Further, changes in response latency throughout the sustained visual search task were positively associated with changes in response latency during a 30-min, low signal probability task, a 45-min low signal probability task, and a 45-min high signal probability task. The findings indicate that the sustained visual search task may be a valid alternative to a longer-duration process control task for experimental studies, and is likely to be of value for assessments of the capacity for sustained attention of operators in process control environments.",

    "abstract": "There is increasing interest in applying systems Human Factors and Ergonomics (HFE) methods in sport. Risk assessment (RA) methods can be used identify risks which may impact the performance of individual athletes, teams, and overall sports systems; however, they have not yet been tested in sport. This study sets out to apply and compare three systems thinking-based RA methods in the context of elite sports performance and report on the frequency and types of the risks identified. The Systems-Theoretic Process Analysis (STPA) method, the Event Analysis of Systemic Teamwork Broken Links (EAST-BL) method, and the Networked Hazard Analysis and Risk Management System (Net-HARMS) method were applied to elite women's road cycling to identify all the credible risks that could degrade optimal team performance. The findings demonstrate that all three methods appear to provide useful results in a context other than safety, and that multiple risks threatening the performance of the cycling team were identified. Whilst the frequency and types of risks differed across the methods applied, there are additional theoretical, methodological, and practical implications to be considered prior to the selection and use of systems thinking-based RA approaches. Recommendations and directions for future HFE and sports science research are discussed.",

Mission averages reflected suboptimal sleep that was of short overall duration (5:46 ± 1:29 h per 24-h day) and relatively low efficiency (82.5 ± 9.9%); suboptimal levels of cognitive performance (PVT mRT = 283 ± 35 ms; PVT response errors = 5.3 ± 4.8); and moderate levels of self-reported recovery. Whilst self-reported recovery status remained stable across mission days, small but consistent day-to-day increases in sleep onset latency and PVT mRT accumulated to reflect meaningful deterioration in sleep and cognitive performance across the entire 67-day mission (i.e., 47% and 16% of the overall mission average, respectively). Future work is required to corroborate the current findings, firmly establish underlying causes, and make evidence-based suggestions for interventions to improve and uphold submariners’ health and performance.",

    "abstract": "Medication safety during care transitions is a significant challenge, especially for older adults prescribed multiple medications. Using a systems approach to understand barriers to and strategies for safe medication management throughout high-risk periods of hospital-to-home transition is one important step in designing effective interventions. Framing the care transition as a collaboration between healthcare and patient “work systems,” we conducted semi-structured interviews with 37 clinical team members, representing 10 different professional roles involved in providing transitional care for patients. Thematic analyses identified key strategies used by clinical team members in preparing patients to self-manage medications safely in the home environment: (1) streamlining and coordinating clinical management of medication reconciliation across care settings; (2) building patient capacity and engagement in self-management of medications; and (3) redesigning the transitional process. Our research highlights the value in aligning professionals’ care transition goals with patients and caregiver(s) to better prepare them to self-manage medications upon discharge.",

    "abstract": "For shoulder muscle prevention, we investigated individual shoulder muscle performance and fatigue patterns in various external conditions, including three different % maximum voluntary contractions, six shoulder angles and 60-s durations of exertion. The rating of perceived exertion was also measured for comparison. The upper trapezius (UT), middle deltoid (MD), pectoralis major (PM), latissimus dorsi (LD) and serratus anterior (SA) were selected for assessment. Normalized median power frequency electromyograms were calculated for quantitative fatigue evaluation in ten participants. UT muscle was severely fatigued by extreme flexion angle rather than weight. MD muscle was the most rapidly fatigued after 15 s duration. SA muscle was more fatigued at 0° than 30° adduction. LD and PM muscle fatigue were mostly due to external workload. This muscle specific outcome could help practitioners to design an intervention program targeting particular shoulder injury.",

    "abstract": "Stair design can influence the risk of stair falls. Stair nosings are intended to provide greater foot accommodation, although to date little is known about how the nosing shape can affect foot trajectory during stair ambulation. This study investigates the impact of different nosing shapes (round, square, tapered, and no nosing) on foot clearance and overhang measures during stair ascent and descent among healthy and post-stroke older adults. Slower cadence in ascent and descent, and greater foot overhang during descent highlighted the increased risk of stair falls for persons with chronic stroke. For both healthy and post-stroke participants, the tapered and round nosing shapes resulted in the largest horizontal foot clearance, and smallest foot overhang, respectively. However, given the greater step-to-step variability detected with round nosings, the tapered nosing presents as the safest choice among all evaluated designs. The results of this work can be used to inform architectural and accessible design standards for a safer built environment.",

    "abstract": "The effect of the load's center of gravity (CoG) on manual materials handling tasks received little attention in literature. The motivation of this study was to examine the effects of handle height, load's CoG height and load on lifting tasks. Eighteen participants performed 27 lifting tasks, including 3 handle heights (10, 30, 50 cm) by 3 load's CoG heights (10, 30, 50 cm) by 3 loads (7, 14, 21 kg). The lifting time, maximum box tilt angle, muscular activity (brachioradialis, biceps brachii, deltoid, and erector spinae), maximum CoP velocity, and lifting difficulty were measured. The results showed that lifting time and maximum box tilt angle decreased with increasing handle height. Middle handle height (30 cm) resulted in the lowest muscular activity, maximum CoP velocity, and lifting difficulty. Low load's CoG height decreased lifting time, maximum box tilt angle, muscular activity, and lifting difficulty, however, it also increased maximum CoP velocity. In addition, high load increased lifting time, maximum box tilt angle, muscular activity, maximum CoP velocity, and lifting difficulty.",

    "abstract": "Digital human modeling software uses biomechanical models to compute workers' risk of injury during industrial work processes. In many cases, the biomechanics are calculated using quasistatic models, which neglect the body's dynamics and therefore might be erroneous. This study investigated the differential effect of using a dynamic vs. a quasistatic model on spinal loading during combined manual material handling tasks that are prevalent in industry. An experiment was conducted involving nine male and nine female participants performing a total of 3402 cycles of a box-conveying task (removing, carrying and depositing) for different box masses and shelf heights. Using motion capture data, the peak and cumulative moments acting on the L5/S1 joint were calculated using 3D dynamic and quasistatic models. This revealed that neglecting the dynamic movements (i.e., using a quasistatic model) results in an on average underestimation of 19.7% in the peak spinal moment and 3.6% in the cumulative moment that in some cases exceeds the maximal limit for the compression forces acting on the lower back.",

    "abstract": "Despite the emergence of head-worn displays at work around forty years ago, few studies have appeared about their impact on job content. To investigate this, a systematic literature review was conducted on these devices and job content, defined as job demands and controls. In total, 3481 studies were identified using five scientific databases. After applying selection criteria, reference searches, citation tracking and an in-depth reading, 28 studies were selected for review. Remarkably, the findings of these studies showed contrasting results. Both increases and decreases in job demands and controls were identified. We distinguished across studies two opposite approaches for the deployment of these devices, i.e. a supportive and a directive approach.",

    "doi": "10.1016/j.apergo.2020.103307",
    "abstract": "Twenty participants (18 males and 2 females) completed postural stability assessments before and after 4-h exposure to whole body vibration (WBV) in four experimental conditions: (a) vertical-dominant WBV with vertical passive air suspension, (b) multi-axial WBV with vertical passive air suspension, (c) multi-axial WBV with multi-axial active suspension, and (d) no WBV condition. Center of pressure (COP)-based postural sway measures significantly increased following multi-axial WBV exposure. Increase in COP velocity and displacement following multi-axial WBV was significantly higher than the increase in all the other exposure conditions. However, no significant differences between the WBV conditions were observed in functional limits of stability and anticipatory postural adjustments. While our results show standing balance to be impaired following the multi-axial WBV exposure of off-road mining vehicles, dynamic stability across a broader range of conditions needs to be understood to causally link postural stability decrements to increased fall-risks associated with off-road vehicle operators.",

    "abstract": "Automated aids are engineered to support operators’ decision-making in complex and task-saturated environments, alerting them of system status and critical incidents. However, even the most advanced technologies are susceptible to failure. Monitoring imperfect automated systems poses unique challenges related to operator attention and workload. This study empirically examined the effect of unreliable automation on monitoring performance and responses to auditory stimuli in a multi-tasking environment. Participants completed an experimental trial consisting of four flight-related tasks while monitoring for automation failures at one of three levels of automation reliability. Participants in a high reliability condition responded more quickly and frequently to auditory messages. No performance differences were found in system monitoring performance between reliability conditions. These results are relevant to the design of automated system and delivery of automated alerts, and they have implications for operator attention allocation strategies in multi-tasking environments.",

    "abstract": "This study was conducted at 5 Veterans Administration Medical Centers (VAMCs). A cross sectional survey was administered to 134 workers who routinely lift and mobilize patients within their workplaces’ safe patient handling and mobility (SPHM) programs, which are mandated in all VAMCs. The survey was used to examine a comprehensive list of SPHM and non-SPHM variables, and their associations with self-reported musculoskeletal injury and pain. Previously unstudied variables distinguished between “bariatric” (≥300 lb or 136 kg) and “non-bariatric” (<300 lb or 136 kg) patient handling. Significant findings from stepwise and logistic regression provide targets for workplace improvements, predicting: lower injury odds with more frequently having sufficient time to use equipment, higher back pain odds with more frequent bariatric handling, lower back pain odds with greater ease in following SPHM policies, and lower odds of upper extremity pain with more bariatric equipment, and with higher safety climate ratings.",

    "abstract": "Anthropometry is critical for product and workplace design. Highly prevalent, office work is associated with sedentarism and physical discomfort due to prolonged sitting. Dynamic seating (alternating across sitting, perching, and standing) has been suggested as an alternative to overcome those problems. The current study tested a large sample of anthropometric data for mismatch levels against national and international office furniture standards using dynamic seating as a framework with traditional and perching mismatch equations, applied to three recommended dynamic seating components. Dimensions present in the standards used did not match the majority of the sample. For sitting, seat width and depth individually presented the lowest levels of match, as well as under cumulative fit of all office furniture dimensions. However, these were alleviated when incorporating adjustability. Perching was shown to be generally impeded given commercially-available chair height options. Limitations in state-of-the-art perching equations are discussed, and two new models are proposed as design alternatives. Further research should focus on testing the criteria presented in this research through discomfort and objective measures.",

    "abstract": "Antibiotic-resistant infections cause over 20 thousand deaths and $20 billion annually in the United States. Antibiotic prescribing decision making can be described as a “tragedy of the commons” behavioral economics problem, for which individual best interests affecting human decision-making lead to suboptimal societal antibiotic overuse. In 2015, the U.S. federal government announced a $1.2 billion National Action Plan to combat resistance and reduce antibiotic use by 20% in inpatient settings and 50% in outpatient settings by 2020. We develop and apply a behavioral economics model based on game theory and “tragedy of the commons” concepts to help illustrate why rational individuals may not practice ideal stewardship and how to potentially structure three specific alternate approaches to accomplish these objectives (collective cooperative management, usage taxes, resistance penalties), based on Ostrom's economic governance principles. Importantly, while each approach can effectively incentivize ideal stewardship, the latter two do so with 10–30% lower utility to all providers. Encouraging local or state-level self-managed cooperative stewardship programs thus is preferred to national taxes and penalties, in contrast with current trends and with similar implications in other countries.",

    "abstract": "Objective To identify requirements for human-in-the-loop simulation capabilities and improve their utility in predicting and optimizing soldier-systems integration. Background Technological development rates within the military are rapidly increasing. Emergent technologies often exclude in-depth consideration of human-system interactions until the physical prototyping phase. Human-in-the-loop simulation tools can allow for earlier consideration of humans in the development process; however, use remains limited. Method Semi-structured interviews were conducted with key informants to yield perspectives on current human-in-the-loop simulation capabilities and utility specific to the military. An inductive approach to thematic analysis was used to extract critical themes from transcribed interview data. A scoping review was completed to supplement the data obtained from interviews and summarize knowledge regarding requirements for human-in-the-loop simulation and analysis capabilities targeted to the military. Results Interviews were conducted with five experts representing the sectors of Vehicle/Equipment Design, Simulation, and Army Research. A total of 2274 sources were identified, and 64 papers were retained for the scoping review. Thematic analysis of the combined data sources yielded six important themes to consider with respect to requirements for future human-in-the-loop simulation capabilities targeting soldier-systems integration. Conclusion This study has identified eight key requirements to support the use of human-in-the-loop simulation tools to predict and optimize soldier-systems integration and performance. Application Addressing key requirements will improve the ability of current human-in-the-loop simulation tools to accommodate the military's need for human consideration early in the design process.",

    "abstract": "Most usability assessments of medical devices describe the problems of individual devices in detail, but few account for the real context of use or provide designers with actionable guidelines for improvement. To fill this gap, this paper reports the results of a case study on the usability of operating room technologies and documents the creation of contextual design guidelines for operating room device design. We spent 64 h in a gynecological operating unit conducting interviews with staff and observing device use during surgery. With qualitative analysis methods and based on existing usability principles, we created 21 design guidelines for the operating room context. The new guidelines highlight interactions between multiple devices, staff members, as well as other contextual factors. While the guidelines require further validation, they can potentially support the creation of more safe, ergonomic, and intuitive medical devices.",

    "doi": "10.1016/j.apergo.2020.103286",
    "abstract": "Thousands of people work in the precast/pre-stressed concrete industry every day. Due to the design of the precast/prestressed concrete product itself and the processes required for its production, employees are occasionally exposed to hazards. The industry recognizes this and devotes a significant amount of time and investment to mitigate these hazards and protect employees from harm. It is essential for employees to go through appropriate safety training before starting work in the plant. Practical safety training should be cost-effective, and performance guaranteed, and traditional training procedures include paper-based safety guidelines, lectures, videos, and on-site training. Virtual Reality (VR) provides an innovative approach for safety training as it could offer situational training with negligible risk and at a low cost. In this paper, a VR training module is developed to deliver safety training in a cost-effective yet repeatable manner, aiming to reduce common plant injuries. The module is developed using Unity3D and Visual Studio joint platforms and can be interfaced with using the Oculus Rift/Oculus S. The module addresses three major safety concerns in the plant: personal protective equipment (PPE), the tensioning of strand (the stressing process), and suspended loads. Efficacy and effectiveness analyses were conducted to evaluate the performance of the proposed VR module. The efficacy analysis was based on simulation sickness, user experience, and system usability. This analysis showed that the developed VR module is a user-friendly simulator with minimal simulation sickness. More than 50% of the participants reported no indications of simulation sickness. In addition, an effectiveness analysis was performed based upon a comparative study of this VR training method and the traditional video-based training method. This analysis indicated that VR training is more engaged and provides a better understanding of safety protocols and real-life experience of the precast/prestressed concrete plant.",

To minimize vibration-induced pathologies, ISO identified WBV exposure limits based on vibration transmissibility and apparent mass studies. The ISO guidelines do not account for variations in posture or movement. In our study, we measured the transmissibility and apparent mass at the mouth, lower back, and leg of participants during stationary and propelled walking. Stationary walking transmissibility was significantly higher at the lumbar spine and bite bar at 5 and 10 Hz compared to all higher frequencies while the distal tibia was lower at 5 Hz compared to 10 and 15 Hz. Propelled walking transmissibility was significantly higher at the bite bar and knee at 2 Hz than all higher frequencies. These results vary from previously published transmissibility values for static participants, showing that ISO standards should be adjusted for active workers.",

Older male workers aged 51–69 years (older group: OG, n = 23) and younger male reference individuals aged 25–36 years (younger group: YG, n = 16) performed the experiment. Response time, accuracy, and 3D shoulder/arm kinematics were acquired using motion capture. The effects of age were investigated using linear mixed model analysis. Response times were significantly longer for OG compared with YG (P < 0.001) while no marked differences in the accuracy was observed (P = 0.729). OG showed less hammer displacement and smaller range of motion in the shoulder. Although older workers seemed to use a less biomechanical demanding motor strategy, their response times during hammering were about twice that of younger individuals.",

    "abstract": "Since the inception of High Reliability Theory in 1981, researchers and practitioners have theorized about the questions, “How do you know if you're an HRO, and how do you validate it?” Evidence now exists that organizations seeking high reliability and resilience have moved away from the theoretical phase, and into the application phase where organizations adopt the HRO hallmarks plus culture as operational targets and create interventions to effect change. The evidence of high reliability operations in organizations is key for validating that HRO is implementable and is also beneficial. After collecting over 1400 artifacts, we found 34 scholarly efforts published which purposefully targeted implementation measures toward achieving an HRO state and measured the outcomes. From that evidence, we concluded that three specific interventions have been used which were useful and generalizable to guide practitioners in moving toward an HRO state: process redesign, training, and organization redesign. We suggest that this evidence may assert that organizations which are not functioning as an HRO can be redesigned to do so.",

    "abstract": "Characterization of Whole-Body Vibration (WBV) exposure is important for the development and evaluation of mitigation strategies for occupational WBV. However, barriers associated with cost and complexity limit widespread use of current gold-standard accelerometer (GSA) measurement systems. Small, simple, low cost Acceleration Measurement Unit (AMU) devices with built-in batteries and memory potentially allow for more efficient collection of WBV data, but the measurement accuracy of these devices need to be evaluated. Using known acceleration inputs generated by an accelerometer calibrator and field collected vibration profiles simulating real-world vibration exposures, the measurements of an AMU device and GSA system were compared. Analysis of accelerometer calibrator data showed no significant difference in weighted acceleration (Aw) measurements between the systems (mean difference −0.001 m/s2, p = 0.95). In field collected vibration profile testing, differences in Aw measurements were small (0.06 m/s2, 4.6%). These results suggest the AMU evaluated in this study may be acceptable for measuring occupational WBV.",

    "abstract": "Countdown timers (CDTs) for pedestrians and cars have been shown to produce various effects, including improved efficiency and decreased safety. This study aimed to explore adaptive behaviours of cyclists towards a CDT to green traffic light, conducted as a before-after study in real traffic. Cyclists adapted to the CDT by searching for and using the information that it provided, mainly in terms of speed adaptation and glance behaviour. Start-up delays were reduced but there is a concern that red light violations could increase. There might be undesirable effects on crucial information intake in cases where the CDT was used not as a complement but as a substitute for the traffic light. The results essentially indicate that cyclists use the information provided by the CDT for their own efficiency, rather than for rule-based safety.",

    "abstract": "Autonomous vehicle (AV) technology has brought a shift in the traditional role of the driver. This paper applies a user-centred design approach to designing a new AV interior to better support drivers. Three empirical studies were conducted, involving a total of 92 drivers (with 44 in Study 1, 12 in Study 2, and 36 in Study 3) to explore user needs and requirements in an AV. In Study 1, safety and comfort, together with a variety of non-driving activities, were identified as the principal concerns about future autonomous vehicles. Based on these findings, Study 2 proposes a new rotatable seating position for AVs, with an in-vehicle information display to facilitate users' activities and situational awareness while driving. Study 3 consists of a series of laboratory simulator evaluation studies, and this indicated that drivers in the proposed design condition had better situational awareness in an AV when dealing with take-over situations. Such findings suggest the possibility of applying rear-facing seats in autonomous vehicles to support in-vehicle non-driving activities. Some specific implications of designs to enhance a driver's situational awareness have also been suggested.",

    "abstract": "Decision-making during critical outbreak management may require standard strategies, but also more creative ones. Our goal was to characterize the expert decision processes that take place during critical situations, where rule-based strategies and usual procedures cannot be satisfactorily applied. More specifically, we focused on the strategies experts use to deal with epidemiological problems, depending on the complexity of the situation. To this end, we carried out a simulated outbreak alert, to place two experts in a situation of epidemiological problem management, based on usual practice but also conducive to implementing creative solutions. To analyze the data, we considered not only the relevance of the solutions proposed by the experts, but also the four creativity criteria defined by Torrance (fluency, flexibility, elaboration and originality). Results allowed us to identify similarities but also differences between the solutions proposed by the experts, depending on their level of experience in this area.",

Methods We conducted semi-structured interviews with Intensive Care Unit (ICU) staff exploring perceptions of wireless patient monitoring. We used the Systems Engineering Initiative for Patient Safety (SEIPS) model to guide thematic analysis. Results We identified usability themes relating to staff perceptions of current patient monitoring experiences, staff perceptions of patient/relative expectations of ICU care, troubleshooting, hierarchy of monitoring, and consensus of trust. Conclusion The concept of wireless monitoring has perceived benefits for patients and staff. The Systems Engineering Initiative for Patient Safety model guided a systems-based exploratory evaluation. Results highlight the social and environmental factors which may influence usability, adoption, or abandonment of wireless technology in the ICU.",

    "abstract": "Research in aviation and driving has highlighted the importance of training as an effective approach to reduce the costs associated with the supervisory role of the human in automated systems. However, only a few studies have investigated the effect of training on highly automated driving. Moreover, available interactive trainings are mostly based on automated driving simulators and the application of immersive technology such as Virtual Reality (VR) as a low-cost training solution has not been widely adopted. In this study, we developed three types of familiarization tours (low-fidelity VR, high-fidelity VR, and video) to train first-time users of highly automated cars. Then, the effectiveness of these tours was investigated on automation trust and driving performance in several critical and non-critical transition tasks in four groups: control, video, low-fidelity VR, and high-fidelity VR. The results revealed the positive impact of the tours on trust and transition performance at the first time of measurement. Takeover quality only improved when practices were presented in high-fidelity VR. After three times of exposure to transition requests, trust and transition performance of all groups converged to those of the high-fidelity VR group, demonstrating that: a) experiencing takeover transition during the training may reduce costs associated with first critical takeover request in highly automated driving, b) the VR tour with high level of interaction fidelity was superior to other training methods, and c) untrained and less-trained drivers learned about automation after a few trials. Knowledge resulting from this research could help develop cost-effective solutions for automated driving training in dealerships and car rental centers.",

However, work can also be a health enhancement opportunity and it also can be designed to improve health and well-being. This research presents a novel intervention designed to reduce sedentary behavior in the workplace. Seven teams of employees (N = 30) conducted two meetings: one in a sitting position and one on a stationary bike. Repeated measures for heart rate, perceptions of stress, well-being, focus, attention and fatigue were collected before, during and after both meetings. Heart rate was significantly higher during active meeting. Results also indicated a significant effect of active meeting on stress. Well-being, focus and attention were similar during both meetings. Fatigue was perceived to be reduced in the hours following the active meeting. This suggests that active meetings can promote health without impairing performance which offers new perspectives for interventions.",

    "doi": "10.1016/j.apergo.2020.103266",
    "abstract": "A portable headset has been developed to analyze breathing gases and establish the energetic workload of physically active workers. This proof-of-concept study aimed to investigate the following: (1) the validity of the headset compared to indirect calorimetry using a mouth mask; (2) the validity of the headset compared to the validity of oxygen consumption (V̇O2) estimated on the basis of heart rate; (3) the influence of wind on validity; and (4) user experiences of the headset. Fifteen subjects performed a submaximal cycling test twice, once with the headset, and once with a mouth mask and heartrate monitor. Concurrent validity of the headset was analyzed using an intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC). Across all phases, a good correlation between the headset and mouth mask was observed for V̇O2, carbon dioxide production (V̇CO2) and exhaled volume (V̇E) (ICC≥0.72). The headset tended to underestimate V̇O2, V̇CO2 and V̇E at low intensities and to overestimate it at higher intensities. The headset was more valid for estimating V̇O2 (ICC = 0.39) than estimates based on heart rate (ICC = 0.11) (n = 7). Wind flow caused an overestimation (md ≥ 18.4 ± 16.9%) and lowered the correlation of V̇O2 between the headset and the mouth mask to a moderate level (ICC = 0.48). The subjects preferred the headset over the mouth mask because it was more comfortable, did not hinder communication and had lower breathing resistance. The headset appears to be useable for monitoring development of the energetic workloads of physically active workers, being more valid than heart rate monitoring and more practical than indirect calorimetry with a mouth mask. Proof-of-concept was confirmed. Another design step and further validation studies are needed before implementation in the workplace.",

    "abstract": "Advancements in sensing and network technologies have increased the amount of data being collected to monitor the worker conditions. In this study, we consider the use of time series methods to forecast physical fatigue using subjective ratings of perceived exertion (RPE) and gait data from wearable sensors captured during a simulated in-lab manual material handling task (Lab Study 1) and a fatiguing squatting with intermittent walking cycle (Lab Study 2). To determine whether time series models can accurately forecast individual response and for how many time periods ahead, five models were compared: naïve method, autoregression (AR), autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA), vector autoregression (VAR), and the vector error correction model (VECM). For forecasts of three or more time periods ahead, the VECM model that incorporates historical RPE and wearable sensor data outperformed the other models with median mean absolute error (MAE) < 1 . 24 and median MAE < 1 . 22 across all participants for Lab Study 1 and Lab Study 2, respectively. These results suggest that wearable sensor data can support forecasting a worker’s condition and the forecasts obtained are as good as current state-of-the-art models using multiple sensors for current time prediction.",

    "doi": "10.1016/j.apergo.2020.103218",
    "abstract": "Operating a small carry-on unmanned aerial system (UAS) alone is challenging. Research on facilitating single-operator work has focused mainly on payload operation and health monitoring. Little focus has been given to mission-related aspects and how the command and control (C2) map display contributes to mission accomplishment. This study uses cognitive work analysis (CWA) to describe the operational work of the mission operator of a Skylark miniature UAS system. Three CWA phases were conducted – work domain analysis, control task analysis and strategy analysis – providing a rich framework of operational mission phases, task components, processes and the physical interface-objects in use. These representations highlight the operators' extensive use of the C2 map during all mission phases, for all object-related processes. To further enhance the outcomes of the CWA, and prior to outlining specific design requirements, an empirical investigation was conducted in which the eye movements of five experienced operators were obtained during a simulated mission. The empirical results confirm and further specify the work patterns that operators adopt. Quantitative analysis shows operators’ extensive focus on the map, especially during mission-critical phases. These analyses led to the conclusion that a significant change in the way operators interact with the C2 map, or alternative designs to enhance map-based information utilization, should be applied. Insights drawn from this analysis can be applied to other aerial surveillance work domains, and adding empirical evaluations is helpful to further refine and reinforce the CWA outcomes.",

    "abstract": "Nursing is often hazardous work. Promoting safety and care requires nurses to apply knowledge, skill and creativity in patient encounters. Nurses' risk exposures are well documented, with research on student nurses' safety more limited. We studied final-year nursing students’ risk perceptions using questionnaire-based vignettes involving four patient presentations on patient aggression, manipulating patient and resource risk factors. We found student nurses were most likely to ask for help and wait when managing high-risk patient aggression scenarios. Student nurses placed most importance on their own safety and patient condition in making decisions. Resource risk significantly interacted with gender, with male nurses more likely to seek help when risks were high. There is need to improve student nurse training on managing patient aggression by promoting creative approaches to problem solving and critical thinking using simulation techniques to enhance situation awareness and translate knowledge to practice.",

    "abstract": "We report an organization's method for recruiting additional, specialized human resources during anomaly handling. The method has been tailored to encourage sharing adaptive capacity across organizational units. As predicted by Woods' theory, this case shows that sharing adaptive capacity allows graceful extensibility that is particularly useful when a system is challenged by frequent but unpredictably severe events. We propose that (1) the ability to borrow adaptive capacity from other units is a hallmark of resilient systems and (2) the deliberate adjustment adaptive capacity sharing is a feature of some forms of resilience engineering. Some features of this domain that may lead to discovery of resilience and promote resilience engineering in other settings, notably hospital emergency rooms.",

    "abstract": "Curved displays are believed to create a feeling of immersiveness similar to virtual reality. However systematic studies are needed to demonstrate that this is, in fact, true and under what conditions. In an experimental study 24 participants compared five different displays (concave, convex, hemisphere, sphere and a flat display) in terms of their immersiveness and perceptibility, and they also rated their overall preferences. Both immersiveness and perceptibility affected overall preference ratings. Participants gave higher preference ratings to the convex and concave displays, which were rated high in immersiveness and perceptibility, but gave lower preference ratings to the hemisphere/spherical display which had high ratings on immersiveness but low ratings on perceptibility. The study results imply that curved displays do indeed create a feeling of immersiveness. Concave and convex displays were rated highly favorably and should receive more attention for applications where visual experience and a feeling of immersiveness is particularly important.",

    "abstract": "The risk of motion sickness is considerably higher in autonomous vehicles than it is in human-operated vehicles. Their introduction will therefore require systems that mitigate motion sickness. We investigated whether this can be achieved by augmenting the vehicle interior with additional visualizations. Participants were immersed in motion simulations on a moving-base driving simulator, where they were backward-facing passengers of an autonomous vehicle. Using a Head-Mounted Display, they were presented either with a regular view from inside the vehicle, or with augmented views that offered additional cues on the vehicle’s present motion or motion 500ms into the future, displayed on the vehicle’s interior panels. In contrast to the hypotheses and other recent studies, no difference was found between conditions. The absence of differences between conditions suggests a ceiling effect: providing a regular view may limit motion sickness, but presentation of additional visual information beyond this does not further reduce sickness.",

Half of the plans were solved at another level in the organisation than the challenge appeared. Actions planned on the individual level had the highest implementation rate (52%).

    "doi": "10.1016/j.apergo.2020.103239",
    "abstract": "Modeling the shape of the scalp and face is essential for the design of protective helmets and other head-borne equipment. However, head anthropometry studies using optical scanning rarely capture scalp shape because of hair interference. Data on scalp shape is available from bald men, but female data are generally not available. To address this issue, scalp shape was digitized in an ethnically diverse sample of 100 adult women, age 18–59, under a protocol that included whole head surface scanning and scalp measurement using a three-dimensional (3D) coordinate digitizer. A combined male and female sample was created by adding 3D surface scans of a similarly diverse sample of 80 bald men. A statistical head shape model was created by standardizing the head scan data. A total of 58 anatomical head landmarks and 12 head dimensions were obtained from each scan and processed along with the scans. A parametric model accounting for the variability of the head shape under the hair as a function of selected head dimensions was developed. The full-variable model has a mean shape error of 3.8 mm; the 95th percentile error was 7.4 mm, which were measured at the vertices. The model will be particularly useful for generating a series of representing a target population as well as for generating subject-specific head shapes along with predicted landmarks and dimensions. The model is publicly available online at http://humanshape.org/head/.",

The aim of this study is to provide and compare quantitative data on loads in the low back area resulting from the use of a motorless stand-and-turn device and from manual patient handling. Nine caregivers participated to motion capture and ground reaction forces measurement sessions of three cases of handling: manual handling with one caregiver, manual handling with two caregivers, motorless device assisted handling. Forces and torques at the L5/S1 joint were computed through Inverse Dynamics process. Motorless device assisted handling required the smallest loads whereas manual handling with one caregiver required the biggest loads, the latter being in some cases twice as big as the former. Caregivers should use a stand-and-turn device when handling a patient from sitting/standing to standing/sitting position whenever it is possible.",

    "abstract": "Superimposing virtual visual information within the real world is referred to as augmented reality (AR). This technique becomes increasingly popular and due to technical advances can be applied to various purposes ranging from consumer entertainment to industrial use cases. Workplaces equipped with AR assistance-systems promise fast and accurate performance. Within the field of intralogistics, palletization constitutes a field of application which may benefit from guidance by AR. In the present investigation, participants performed a palletization task while they received instructions via three different devices (paper list, tablet, AR glasses). Performance data and subjective ratings were obtained. Participants subjectively preferred to work with the AR device. Number of errors was reduced while at the same time handling times were prolonged when the AR device was used. In all experimental conditions, performance improved in the course of the experiment. Least improvement was observed in the AR condition, which emphasizes that such applications allow decent performance without prior experience. Overall, the present results indicate that the utility of AR applications is limited when task demands are low. Such applications might be more useful in unclear and complex situations. Furthermore, AR possesses high hedonic qualities which may ease the integration of novel work processes.",

    "abstract": "This study investigated kinematic and perceptual differences between the sexes in a heavy lifting and pulling task. A 20 kg box was lifted from floor to chest height, and a 70 kg mannequin pulled across 20m. The effect of height, mass and average grip strength on kinematics and perceived workload was examined in 42 (19 females, 23 males) healthy individuals. A univariate linear regression analysis found females lifted with greater lumbar extension compared to males (p < 0.001), and adopted more hip (p = 0.006) and knee flexion (p = 0.036) in the pulling task. Females reported a greater perceived workload in both tasks (p < 0.001). After the multivariable analysis, only grip strength remained significant for perceived workload in the lift (p = 0.04), and height for knee flexion in the pull (p = 0.009). This highlights that height and strength are important factors driving kinematics and perceived workload. Clinicians may consider these factors in heavy manual tasks, more so than sex.",

    "abstract": "Deficits in the accommodative and/or vergence responses have been linked with inattentive behavioral symptoms. While using automated systems (e.g., self-driving cars, autopilot), operators (e.g., drivers, pilots, soldiers) visually monitor displays for critical changes, making deficits in the accommodative and/or vergence responses potentially hazardous for individuals remaining actively engaged in the task at hand. The purpose of this study was to determine if symptoms of accommodative-vergence deficits predict an individual's level of task engagement and cognitive fatigue while performing a flight simulation task with or without automation. Eighty-four participants performed a flight simulation task with or without automation. Prior to task completion, self-report accommodative-convergence deficit symptoms were assessed with the Convergence Insufficiency Symptom Survey (CISS). Before and after the flight simulation task participants rated their task engagement and cognitive fatigue. Electroencephalographic activity (EEG) was recorded concurrently during task performance. Results showed that higher scores on the CISS were related to increased feelings of fatigue and decreased ratings of task engagement. The CISS was also positively related to parietal-occipital fast alpha power during the last 10 min of the task for participants using automation, suggesting increased cortical idling. CISS scores did not predict performance. Results have implications for optimizing operator cognitive states over extended task performance.",

    "abstract": "Automated decision aids can undoubtedly benefit system performance, but have the potential to provide incorrect advice, creating the possibility for automation disuse or misuse. This paper examined the extent to which increased automation transparency could improve the accuracy of automation use in a simulation of unmanned vehicle control. Participants were required to assign the best unmanned vehicle to complete missions. An automated recommender system provided advice but was not always reliable. Three levels of automation transparency were manipulated between-participants. Providing transparency regarding the reasoning underlying automated recommendations improved the accuracy of automation use, with no cost to decision time or subjective workload. Higher transparency in the form of projected decision outcome visualizations led to faster decisions, but less accurate automation use and an automation bias. Implications for the design of transparent interfaces to improve human-autonomy teaming outcomes in time-pressured environments are discussed.",

    "abstract": "Discrepancies exist in backpack load recommendations for obese/overweight children, and the recommendations do not consider school trolleys. This study analysed obese/overweight and healthy-weight students’ perceived load and fatigue when carrying schoolbags and their gait kinematics and rate of perceived exertion (RPE) when carrying backpacks or pulling school trolleys with different loads. Twelve obese/overweight and 36 healthy-weight students were asked about their perceived load and fatigue in carrying their schoolbags to school. Then, a kinematic gait analysis was completed in students walking unloaded or transporting 10%, 15% or 20% of their bodyweight (BW) in a backpack or trolley. RPE was recorded after each condition. The average hip rotation and knee adduction angles differed between body mass index (BMI) groups. The healthy-weight group reported higher RPEs than the overweight/obese group when pulling a trolley with 10–15% BW. In conclusion, both BMI groups responded similarly to load and schoolbag type.",

    "abstract": "Purpose This study investigates the effects of the usage of a novel camera system compared to a conventional lens system for manual precision tasks. Utilizing the novel camera system aims to improve neck posture, reduce neck muscle tension and thereby minimize the risk of neck pain. Methods Camera and lens systems were compared by assessing the craniovertebral angle (CVA), electromyographic activity of the M.trapezius and perceived exertion. 16 healthy participants (n = 8 female, 24 ± 2 years; n = 8 male, 30 ± 5 years) performed manual precision tasks in a cross-over design using both systems in sitting and standing positions. Results Analyses showed that using the camera system improved the CVA in sitting [28.4° (22.8°–33.9°) to 42.5° (38.9°–46.1°); p < 0.01] and decreased the M.trapezius activity in standing [13.1% (7.7%–18.6%) to 8.65% (5.49%–11.81%)]. Additionally, overall and neck specific perceived exertion decreased when using the camera system in standing. Conclusions The camera system may prevent neck pain in workers performing manual precision tasks in sitting and standing postures.",

    "doi": "10.1016/j.apergo.2020.103235",
    "abstract": "In real life, many objects catch our attention involuntarily or exogenously. Exogenous attention occurs fast and its effects are short-lived. In the laboratory, when attentional orientation is studied, both valid and invalid attentional signals are used: the valid ones direct the attention to a location where something relevant is going to appear. The invalid ones occur in a location where nothing relevant is going to happen. Usually, performance is improved when valid signals rather than invalid ones are presented. This work is novel in that it explores the effects of attentional capture and driving experience in situations of day-to-day driving while participants carry out a Hazard Prediction task. We created new Hazard Prediction (HPr) and Risk Estimation (RE) tests when driving by selecting 48 short videos recorded in a realistic way from the perspective of a car driver. We created valid and invalid trials by selecting videos in which a what?? was presented in the same spatial location as the one where the hazard was beginning to develop or in a different location. Simple situations, with only one developing hazard, were also presented. A total of 92 participants (30 experienced drivers, 32 novices and 30 with no experience) were placed in the position of the driver and answered the questions: 1) What will happen after the video is cut? 2) To what extent do you consider this situation risky? The results from the Hazard Prediction test replicate the attentional capture effect in complex driving situations, with invalid trials obtaining the worst results, followed by valid and simple ones. Participants with experience obtained better scores than novices, and novices were better than drivers without experience. No interaction between attentional orientation and experience was found, suggesting the obligatory and automatic nature of orientation processes, which do not appear to be compensated for by driving experience. No significant differences were found for the Risk Estimation test.",

    "abstract": "We present a mesoergonomic approach to the early detection of neonatal sepsis, analyzing clinical data for 4999 patients from a neo-natal intensive care unit to predict positive culture results. The Apgar score at birth predicted positive results. For neonates with poor and intermediate Apgar scores, culture results for monitored infants were more likely to be positive than those for unmonitored infants. Thus, the medical staff tended to monitor infants who eventually had a greater chance for positive test results. A cost-effectiveness analysis indicated that for infants with high Apgar scores, the physician should decide whether to obtain a blood culture, based on the patient's characteristics. For infants with lower Apgar scores, it may be advisable to obtain a blood culture whenever one decides to monitor a neonate. The study demonstrates that staff decisions regarding a patient can serve as input for further clinical decision-making.",

    "abstract": "Municipal waste collectors must avoid bag-body contact, requiring waste bags to be held further from the body. Donning sharps-proof clothing would permit bag-body contact, allowing the bag to be closer to the body, reducing biomechanical exposures. To test this hypothesis, 25 participants loaded waste bags into a simulated garbage truck hopper under two lifting (contact allowed, no contact) and bag mass (7 kg and 20 kg) conditions. Bottom-up rigid-link biomechanical modelling results including peak low back compression force, antero-posterior shear force and peak low back flexion angle were not different between the lifting conditions, but cumulative compression was decreased with bag-body contact, although only at the 20 kg mass. Bag mass had significant effects on outcome measures, causing compression to increase to 4663 (±697) N, exceeding recommended thresholds. Sharps-proof clothing and municipally mandated 23 kg maximum allowable bag mass restrictions may not sufficiently reduce biomechanical exposures to prevent MSD.",

    "abstract": "Powered two-wheelers are a common means of transport all over the world. In several countries, primary motorcycles with high displacement involve another purpose, namely motorcycling is a leisure activity. Motorcycles are used as tools of transport pleasure as opposed to being purely used for individual commuting purposes. The aim of the current study involves investigating the relation between experienced riding pleasure and riding behavior in a field test. Specifically, N = 12 motorcyclists between 21 and 66 years of age were observed while riding for approximately 8 h on public roads. The measurement setup included a logger for vehicle dynamics and vehicle handling data, GNSS data, video data, and subjective measures recorded as audio comments at predefined points of interest along the round course. A comprehensive dataset with more than 6000 km of motorcycling was gathered. The results indicate that parameters of lateral vehicle behavior, such as the maximum lean angle, reflected riding pleasure. Interestingly, this is applicable for curvy sections as well as straight roads. High ratings of riding pleasure correlated with riding in snaky lines as a type of self-stimulation on straight sections. Longitudinal vehicle dynamics, such as the range of accelerations, tend to increase with the riding pleasure in curves. Hence, the effects are smaller than those for lateral vehicle behavior and not visible on straight sections. Generally, curvy sections on rural roads produce higher pleasure than straight roads. On a global level, riding pleasure increases during the first few hours of riding and subsequently decreases with respect to the time on task. The results are discussed in the context of studies on driving pleasure from the automotive sector and more fundamental psychological theories that explain pleasure as a physiological stimulation or flow. Several individuals ride motorcycles to experience pleasure. A better understanding of rider behavior in these situations can aid in deriving proper assistance and to provide individual support to a rider, thereby increasing riding pleasure as well as safety.",

    "abstract": "Repositioning patients in bed is the most common patient handling activity and is associated with musculoskeletal disorders in caregivers. Hospital bed features may mitigate the risk of injury. The current study investigated the effect of bed features on the physical stress on caregivers. Ten nurses were recruited to perform three repositioning activities. Hand forces were recorded, and spine loading was estimated using a dynamic biomechanical model. Results demonstrated that except for the peak L5/S1 compressive load in the turning task, the use of assistive features significantly reduced the physical stresses for all repositioning activities. However, recommended thresholds for injury were still exceeded in many conditions. Compared with spinal load, hand force was much higher relative to the injury thresholds, suggesting a greater risk of shoulder and upper extremity injuries than low back injury. Mechanical lift equipment remains the safest and most robust way to reposition a patient.",

This study provides novel quantitative data on muscle loading experienced during pill crushing. The influence of surface height, number of pills and device orientation were studied in twelve muscles of the upper extremity. Variations in the work surface height and number of pills crushed resulted in static shoulder and forearm muscle activations that exceeded recommended static limits. In most cases, working at approximately a 50th percentile female's hip height (87 cm) reduced the level of muscle activity, often to below the EMG-based exposure limit, compared to higher heights. A perpendicularly oriented device required substantially lower muscle activity in some shoulder muscles, with marginal differences occurring in muscles of the elbow and wrist. These data can inform practical design and work practice recommendations to reduce muscular activity while performing this important healthcare task.",

    "abstract": "The objective of this study was to assess the impact of using alternative mast climbing work platform (MCWP) designs on trunk motion and postural stability with masonry workers while performing bricklaying and stepping down tasks using a conventional MCWP setting (i.e. with a step deck) as well as two types of production tables (straight- and L-shaped). The trunk angles and postural sway parameters of twenty-five masonry workers were recorded for the following tasks: (1) standing on a simulated MCWP and laying bricks on an adjacent wall, and (2) stepping down onto the step deck to get into position for doing the bricklaying task. Results indicated that the use of the L-shaped production table resulted in the lowest trunk ranges of motion and significantly reduced the workers' trunk angles in all three planes when compared to both the straight-shaped production table and the conventional approach of not using a production table. Data showed that both body sway velocity and area were significantly reduced when using either one of the production tables. The use of production tables significantly reduced impact sway forces when workers stepped from the main platform to the step deck. The use of production tables on MCWPs improved workers’ postures and overall stability, which could reduce the risk of injury.",

    "abstract": "Training of surgeons is essential for safe and effective use of robotic surgery, yet current assessment tools for learning progression are limited. The objective of this study was to measure changes in trainees’ cognitive and behavioral states as they progressed in a robotic surgeon training curriculum at a medical institution. Seven surgical trainees in urology who had no formal robotic training experience participated in the simulation curriculum. They performed 12 robotic skills exercises with varying levels of difficulty repetitively in separate sessions. EEG (electroencephalogram) activity and eye movements were measured throughout to calculate three metrics: engagement index (indicator of task engagement), pupil diameter (indicator of mental workload) and gaze entropy (indicator of randomness in gaze pattern). Performance scores (completion of task goals) and mental workload ratings (NASA-Task Load Index) were collected after each exercise. Changes in performance scores between training sessions were calculated. Analysis of variance, repeated measures correlation, and machine learning classification were used to diagnose how cognitive and behavioral states associate with performance increases or decreases between sessions. The changes in performance were correlated with changes in engagement index ( r r m = − . 25 , p < . 001 ) and gaze entropy ( r r m = − . 37 , p < . 001 ). Changes in cognitive and behavioral states were able to predict training outcomes with 72.5% accuracy. Findings suggest that cognitive and behavioral metrics correlate with changes in performance between sessions. These measures can complement current feedback tools used by medical educators and learners for skills assessment in robotic surgery training.",

    "abstract": "The accumulation of sweat and heat between the skin and the prosthesis is one of the common causes of discomfort experienced by post-mastectomy women who wore silicone-type external breast prostheses. This study aimed 1) to investigate the effect of a newly designed heat-reduction mastectomy bra on the thermal responses and thermal comfort performance; and 2) to propose an evaluation protocol for post-mastectomy products. The heat-reduction bra and the conventional bra were made of the same textile materials but the cup of the bra under discussion had a polyurethane cup with a perforated structure along the breast root/inframammary fold. The inframammary fold is often aggravated by heat, sweat, maceration, chafe, and lack of air circulation. Nine healthy male participants were recruited to participate in the study since the women who had undergone double-mastectomy were sensitive about their scars. An ingestible telemetric pill sensor was used to collect the data of core body temperature. Participants performed a 70-min five-phase exercise protocol wearing the heat-reduction bra and the conventional bra together with a silicone prosthesis with ventilation holes on the bottom. Physiological responses (i.e., core body temperature, skin temperature, temperature between bra and prosthesis, skin humidity and humidity between bra and prosthesis) and subjective sensation responses were measured. The results were statistically significant and the conventional mastectomy bra showed a higher core body temperature than that of the heat-reduction mastectomy bra (37.3 ± 0.3 °C to 38.2 ± 0.5 °C vs. 37.2 ± 0.3 °C to 38.0 ± 0.3 °C) starting from the middle of the sitting phase to the running phase and post-exercise resting (F = 164.2, p < 0.001). Both factors, the bra and the phase, have significant effects on the core body temperature (F = 14.5, p < 0.001). The heat-reduction mastectomy bra demonstrated optimum thermal comfort performance in both the temperature and humidity than the conventional mastectomy bra.",

In patient work transitions, patients experience changes in, for example, health, task demands, work capacity, roles and responsibilities, knowledge and skills, routines, needs and technologies. Medication transitions are a particularly vulnerable type of patient work transitions. We describe two cases of medication transitions—new medications and medication deprescribing—in which the patient work lens reveals many accompanying changes, vulnerabilities, and opportunities for human factors and ergonomics.",

    "doi": "10.1016/j.apergo.2020.103237",
    "abstract": "This research represents one of the first qualitative studies to investigate fatigue in the tunnelling sector of the construction industry. It explores the opinions of tunnellers and their managers about how fatigue influences or is influenced by tunnelling, and how this is managed. Fatigue and sleepiness were discussed in six focus groups with frontline workers (n = 42) and 10 manager interviews. Fatigue was seen to be a problem, with all participants having experienced, or recognised in others, the feeling of sleepiness whilst at work. Fatigue and sleepiness are not commonly discussed between tunnelling workers and they do not feel comfortable reporting instances of fatigue. The research shows that workers in the tunnelling construction sector are exposed to a wide range of occupational factors that potentially increase their vulnerability to fatigue, including the physical environment, repetitive and monotonous tasks, variable shift patterns and manual work. Additionally, personal factors such as social and family demands, long commute times and living away from home, can increase the risk of fatigue. The construction industry in general has gone some way to address fatigue and there is opportunity to further improve fatigue management. However, a major shift is needed before workers will feel able to openly discuss fatigue with their employer.",

Methods 36 participants performed a 60-min computer typing task in both configurations using a within-participants, counterbalanced design. Musculoskeletal discomfort and perceived fatigue were reported through surveys; productivity was operationalized by typing speed and typing error; postural risks were assessed by RULA for seated work, and REBA for standing work. Results Musculoskeletal discomfort and perceived fatigue did not vary significantly between configurations. Postural risks for seated and standing work were significantly lower for Ergo-Fit configuration; productivity was significantly higher for Self-Adjusted configuration. Conclusion Use of Ergo-Fit configuration for a sit-stand-walk intervention can facilitate postural transitions and increase physical activity, while enabling neutral postures in seated and standing work to minimize postural risks.",

    "doi": "10.1016/j.apergo.2020.103247",
    "abstract": "Building, bridge or wind turbine maintenance requires manual dexterity tasks by a specialist rope-access trained workforce via two principal means: harness suspension of individual workers from above, or deployment of a suspended platform or cradle from which workers access the structure to be maintained. Currently no published research compares accuracy and efficiency of simulated maintenance tasks between these modalities. This study investigated manual dexterity task performance of peg placement and shape delineation in seated, standing and suspended environments in 16 healthy controls and 26 professional rope-access trained individuals. Both seated and standing assessments were superior to those suspended, and height of suspension, total mass and years of experience had no influence on the task outcome. These findings suggest that, where feasible, cradle suspension mechanisms which permit standing maintenance are favourable in terms of task efficacy and where feasible, should be considered for deployment in wind energy and other engineering applications.",

We generated walking simulations to estimate muscle and joint contact forces of unloaded walking and while carrying 38 kg using shoulder-borne backpacks and hip belt-assisted backpacks for six U.S. Marines. Three-dimensional peak and average lumbar (L4-L5) and hip joint contact forces over the stance phase were compared between each load condition. Axial L4-L5 and axial and anterior hip joint contact forces were greater during both backpack conditions compared to the unloaded condition. Joint contact forces were similar between backpack conditions. Future studies incorporating additional participants, walking conditions, and backpack load distributions are suggested for further model development and backpack design evaluation.",

    "abstract": "The aim of this study was to examine the relationship among attention span, instrument reading, and eye movement mode. Sixteen pilots participated in procedural tests for attention span and instrument reading ability while completing simulated flight take-offs. Different instrument types corresponded to different reaction times – as response time increased, presentation time decreased. It can also be seen from the attention distribution of the instrument area in take-off that different instruments receive different attention resources. Breadth and attention span not only have a direct impact on the ability to read the table but also have a mediating effect on eye movement pattern during flight. The study found a direct relationship between attention span and instrument reading and also verified the impact of the two on attention allocation during take-off. The results suggest that integration training for attention ability with instrument reading may enable more efficient pilot performance.",

    "abstract": "Aim The aim of this study was to assess the work-related physical demands of long-distance truck drivers employed by a large gas delivery company in Canada. Methods A total of 15 truck drivers participated in a data collection that included self-reporting assessments, field observations, and direct measurements to describe daily tasks organization, postural demands, physical workload, and force exertions. Results Truck drivers' work was characterized by long working days ranging from 9.9 to 15.1 h (mean = 11.4 h), with half (49%) of the total working time spent behind the wheel. The overall workload as measured by relative cardiac strain (18.7% RHR) was found excessive for the long term given the shift duration. Peaks of heart rate in excess of 30 beats per minute above the daily average occurred mainly while operating valves and handling heavy hoses during gas deliveries. The task of delivering gas at a client's site required a moderate work rate on average (8.3 mlO2/kg/min) requiring 24.4% or maximum work capacity on average. Conclusion Based on multiple data sources, this study highlights the risks of over-exertion and of excessive physical fatigue in the truck drivers’ work that are coherent with the high prevalence of self-reported musculoskeletal pain in this group of workers.",

    "abstract": "In this article, we compare and evaluate two methods of procedure design using an aircraft go-around (GA) as a test scenario. We contrast the manufacturer specified, crew-centric procedure with a redesigned process-centred perspective. We test the claim that the process-centred design can take into account situational factors more effectively and generate less workload. We report a heuristic assessment of the new procedure against design guidelines and an evaluation in a full-flight simulator at the German Aerospace Centre (DLR) using qualified airline pilots to assess workload and performance. Both the manufacturer specified and new procedure were employed in three GA scenarios representative of increasing operational complexity. Results demonstrate an advantage for the new procedure design in the most complex scenario. The new, process-based procedure can reduce reported crew workload and improve response flexibility in more complex scenarios, improving rated performance. This study suggests that the process-based account in procedure design has advantages when compared to the flight crew-centric approach. These advantages include enhanced flexibility, robustness and improved crew performance during GA.",

    "abstract": "The aim of this research is to investigate whether visual feedback alone can affect a driver's trust in an autonomous vehicle, and in particular, what level of feedback (no feedback vs. moderate feedback vs. high feedback) will evoke the appropriate level of trust. Before conducting the experiment, the Human Machine Interfaces (HMI) were piloted with two sets of six participants (before and after iterations), to ensure the meaning of the displays can be understood by all. A static driving simulator experiment was conducted with a sample of 30 participants (between 18 and 55). Participants completed two pre-study questionnaires to evaluate previous driving experience, and attitude to trust in automation. During the study, participants completed a trust questionnaire after each simulated scenario to assess their trust level in the autonomous vehicle and HMI displays, and on intention to use and acceptance. The participants were shown 10 different driving scenarios that lasted approximately 2 minutes each. Results indicated that the ‘high visual feedback’ group recorded the highest trust ratings, with this difference significantly higher than for the ‘no visual feedback’ group (U = .000; p = <0.001 < α) and the ‘moderate visual feedback’ group (U = .000; p = <0.001 < α). There is an upward inclination of trust in all groups due to familiarity to both the interfaces and driving simulator over time. Participants' trust level was also influenced by the driving scenario, with trust reducing in all displays during safety verses non-safety-critical situations.",

    "abstract": "Right-angle power-tools (RAPT) employed in automotive manufacturing promote greater productivity and quality fastenings, as well as, improve process efficiency. Due to RAPT technological advances automotive manufactures desire to understand their ergonomics consequences within a laboratory environment, however, laboratory-based representation must accurately represent the real world. A survey within automotive assembly plants was conducted to capture RAPT operation data. After examining 80 total RAPT operations, we logged the 3D locations of the fastener location (with respect to the operator), direction and the hand placement location used by operators. Four common locations with respect to the midpoint between the ankle (in cm; X = sagittal plane, Y = transverse plane, Z = coronal plane): 1) 2, 113, 62; 2) 42, 104, 45; 3) -26, 151, 36; 4) -37, 92, 52. These locations can be used to simulate RAPT operations within a laboratory. The survey provided insight into current workstation layout when operating RAPTs and, knowledge for laboratory-based RAPT examinations so that simulated tasks best represent their operation in automotive manufacturing.",

    "abstract": "With advances in information technology, people spend more time on touchscreen-based virtual keyboards than physical keyboards. However, typing on touchscreens usually lacks informative tactile feedback and anchoring references to locate the right keys, and thus requires more visual attention. Most prior tactile keyboard research used single stimulus pattern, which was not enough to recognize different keys. The purpose of this study was to investigate the usability of multiple vibrotactile feedback patterns in an entire virtual QWERTY keyboard input. A set of highly discriminable vibration patterns was designed and associated with different regions of a virtual keyboard to help users to locate the right keys. However, the number of stimulus patterns might also affect the typing performance. A user study was conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of the multiple vibrotactile feedback. The results showed that an appropriate number of stimulus patterns provided higher typing speed, higher typing efficiency, and lower error rate.",

    "abstract": "Falls on icy surfaces are the leading cause of occupational injuries for workers exposed to outdoor winter conditions. Slip resistant footwear has been shown to reduce the risk of falls for indoor workers but until recently, there was no accepted standard for evaluating the slip resistance of winter footwear on icy surfaces. Our team recently developed a lab-based testing protocol for measuring footwear slip resistance. This protocol, called the Maximum Achievable Angle (MAA) test, measures the steepest ice-covered slope that participants can walk up and down without experiencing a slip in a simulated winter environment. This lab-based protocol has found there is wide variability in the performance of commercially available winter footwear. In particular, we have found that a new generation of footwear that incorporates composite materials in the outsole, performs much better than most other footwear. The objective of this project was to investigate whether the footwear that performed well in our lab-based testing would reduce the risk of slips and/or falls in real-world winter conditions. One hundred and ten home healthcare workers from SE Health were recruited for this study and were asked to report their exposure to icy surfaces along with the numbers of slips and numbers of falls they experienced each week using online surveys over eight weeks in the winter. Fifty participants (the intervention group) were provided winter footwear that were among the best performing in the MAA test. The remaining sixty participants (the control group) wore their own footwear for the duration of the study. A total of 563 slips and 36 falls were reported over the eight-week data collection period. The intervention group consistently reported fewer slips (127 vs 436) and fewer falls (6 vs 30) compared to the control group. We found the slip rate in the intervention group was between 68.0% and 68.7% lower than the control group. Similarly, the fall rate was between 78.5% and 81.5% lower in the intervention group compared to the control group. These findings demonstrate that footwear that performs well in the MAA test can reduce the risk of both slips and falls in real-world winter conditions.",

    "abstract": "Users frequently commit typing errors due to input language mode confusion (ILMC) when switching between multiple languages. This study evaluated two mode display cursors (MDCs) as a potential solution to ILMC: the monochrome and color-changing MDCs. Two experiments were conducted to evaluate the two MDCs in different dimensions of usability. Experiment 1 evaluated the effects of MDCs on ILMC and related typing errors and Experiment 2, on self-reported preference, acceptance and annoyance. In Experiment 1, 45 participants were divided into three groups, that each performed multi-language typing using an ordinary mouse cursor and the two MDCs. The color-changing MDC was found to significantly reduce ILMC and related typing errors compared to the ordinary mouse cursor (p < .001). In Experiment 2, 30 participants performed three typical computer tasks using both MDCs. The mean annoyance rating was significantly larger for the color-changing MDC than for the monochrome MDC (p = .037).",

    "abstract": "This quasi-experimental study was conducted in a poultry processing industry with the aim of assessing the benefits of ergonomics educational training for novice and experienced workers in preventing work-related musculoskeletal disorders. Sociodemographic and occupational questionnaires were used to evaluate age, marital status, education, time in job, musculoskeletal complaints and pain intensity, perceived effort, biomechanical exposure, and perception of ease or difficulty in adoption of ergonomics educational training. Musculoskeletal complaints in the neck, back, and wrists were reduced with training, but pain intensity was reduced only in the wrist region. A reduction in the occupational biomechanical exposure from the baseline to immediately post-training and 2 months after training both for novice and experienced workers was also observed. The novice workers group differed from the experienced workers by presenting a higher reduction of biomechanical exposure in the cutting room. All workers in this study benefited from the ergonomics educational training in the short and medium term. However, the success of training was highly dependent on the content and approach of the training.",

    "abstract": "Everyone can be susceptible to motion sickness (except those with complete loss of labyrinth function) and around one in three are known to be servery susceptible. Motion sickness can be experienced in many domains, including car travel, on a boat, using virtual reality headsets and simulator use amongst others. It is expected that due to potential designs and use cases, self-driving cars will increase motion sickness onset likelihood and severity for many car travellers. Besides medication, there are limited methods through which one can actively reduce their motion sickness susceptibility. This research develops a novel visuospatial training tool and explores the effect of visuospatial training on motion sickness. With a combined sample of 42 participants split between driving simulator trials (n = 20), and on-road trials (n = 22) baseline visuospatial skills and motion sickness were first measured. After a 14-day training period where participates completed 15-min of pen and paper tasks per day, it was found that visuospatial skills improved by 40%. This increase in visuospatial ability was shown to be directly responsible for a reduction in motion sickness by 51% in the simulator (with a 60% reduction in participant dropouts) and a 58% reduction in the on-road trial. This research has successfully identified a new method to reduce motion sickness susceptibility and the impact of these findings have wide reaching implications for motion sickness research, especially in the field of self-driving vehicles.",

    "abstract": "The prevalence of musculoskeletal disorders is very high amongmidwives resulting in sickness absenteeism, functional limitation and staff shortages. There are several contributory risk factors having impact on the development of MSDs. This study aimed to (1) explore midwives' experiences and views about work-related MSDs and contributing risk factors, and (2) analyse working postures for musculoskeletal injury risks. A mixed method approach was used with interviews/focus group (n = 15/7) and observations (n = 22) of specific tasks (during birth and after birth) using the posture analysis observational method (Rapid Entire Body Assessment, REBA). The participants were midwives who had an active role in the United Kingdom (UK) National Health Services (NHS). It was found that MSDs were often attributed to the physical (working in awkward positions), organisational (longer shift hours, fewer staff, increased work load), psychosocial (defensive practice, higher demand) challenges of midwifery. All postures had very high to medium REBA risk levels with action categories indicating that action or further assessment is definitely necessary to reduce MSDs. This research provides a holistic approach by analysing risk factors and interactions in the work context to inform the development of risk management strategies. Midwifery working conditions have a big impact on developing musculoskeletal symptoms. Management of such symptoms will improve staff wellbeing, mother and baby safety, individuals' life trajectories and staff shortages.",
