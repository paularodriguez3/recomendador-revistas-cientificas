    "abstract": "Adjustable-height desks may provide musculoskeletal health benefits to offset the effects of prolonged sitting. One mechanism may be increased postural variability, here characterized by head and trunk postural sway. Linear acceleration of the head and trunk were measured while participants used computer workstations in seated and standing positions during keyboard and mouse tasks; secondary measures were discomfort and proprioception (head and neck repositioning error). Median accelerations of the head and trunk were 20–26% lower in mouse tasks compared to keyboard tasks (p < 0.01). There were no significant differences in sway parameters between seated and standing positions. Discomfort and proprioception were correlated; subjects who experienced increased neck discomfort after 1.5 h of computer work had almost twice the head and neck repositioning error. The results suggest that postural sway is more affected by different tasks (keyboard vs. mouse) than by different workstation configurations and that low proprioception acuity may relate to the development of discomfort.",

    "doi": "10.1016/j.apergo.2023.104099",
    "abstract": "Operating an aircraft requires pilots to handle a significant amount of multi-modal information, which creates a high working memory load. Detecting auditory alarms in this high-load scenario is crucial for aviation safety. According to cognitive control load theory, an increase in working memory load may enhance distractor interference, resulting in improved detection sensitivity for task-irrelevant stimuli. Therefore, understanding the effect of working memory load on auditory alarm detection is of particular interest in aviation safety research. The studies were designed to investigate the effect of storage load and executive function load of working memory on auditory alarm detection during aeronautical decision-making through three experiments. In Experiment 1 and 2, participants performed an aeronautical decision-making task while also detecting an auditory alarm during the retention interval of a working memory task (visual-spatial, visual-verbal and auditory-verbal). In Experiment 3, participants were required to detect an auditory alarm while performing the 2-back and 3-back aeronautical decision-making tasks. Experiment 1 found that the auditory alarm sensitivity was higher in conditions of low visual-spatial working memory storage load compare to high load conditions. Experiment 2 found that a high storage load of visual-verbal working memory reduced auditory alarm sensitivity but auditory-verbal working memory load did not. Experiment 3 found that, unlike storage load, auditory alarm sensitivity was stronger under high executive function load relative to low executive function load. These findings show that working memory storage load and executive function load have different effects on auditory alarm sensitivity. The relationship between executive function and auditory alarm sensitivity supports cognitive control load theory, while the impact of the storage function on auditory alarm sensitivity does not adhere to this theory.",

    "journal": "Applied Ergonomics",
    "year": "2023",
    "doi": "10.1016/j.apergo.2023.104101",
    "abstract": "Loss of control in flight is the primary category of fatal accidents within all sectors of aviation and failure to maintain adequate airspeed – leading to a stall - is often cited as a causal factor. Stalls occur when the critical angle of the aircraft is exceeded for a given airspeed. Using airspeed as an indicator of the potential to stall is an unreliable proxy. Systems that measure the angle of attack have been routinely used by military aircraft for over 50 years however rigorous academic research with respect to their effectiveness has been limited. Using a fixed-base flight simulator fitted with a simulated, commercially available angle of attack system, 20 pilots performed normal and emergency procedures during the circuit/pattern in a light aircraft. Experimental results have shown that pilot performance was improved when angle of attack was displayed in the cockpit for normal and emergency procedures during the approach phase of flight in the pattern/circuit. In relation to pilot workload, results indicated that during the approach phase of flight, there was a moderate but tolerable increase in pilot workload. The use of such a display may assist pilots to maintain the aircraft within the optimum range and hence reduce occurrences of unstable approaches. Overall, fewer stall events were observed when angle of attack was displayed and appropriate pilot decisions made during emergencies. These results provide a new perspective on pilot workload and aviation safety.",

    "doi": "10.1016/j.apergo.2023.104048",
    "abstract": "The black hole illusion (BHI) is a subtype of spatial disorientation that can result in fatal consequences in aviation. Research on the BHI has generally focused on altitude deviation, and few studies have examined the effect across different flight phases. In a simulation-based experiment, 18 participants performed 12 simulated approach and landing tasks in normal and BHI environments. Flight performance was analyzed with 14 flight parameters and was compared across five points and three phases, which were referenced from a National Transportation Safety Board report and other previous studies. Results showed that multiple flight parameters were significantly impaired and that their influences varied from the initial approach to the final touchdown. In the BHI environment, participants tended to descend aggressively during the approach phase and flew a lower but similar glidepath during the last approach phase. They might have realized the abnormal situation induced by the BHI but usually were unable to recover from the dangerous maneuver in time. Additionally, the result of glide path error, one of the most commonly used variables in previous BHI research, was only significant during the last approach phase. Flight stability was also impaired in the BHI environment. This is the first study to systematically analyze the BHI effects on multiple flight parameters at different flight phases. The use of this experimental paradigm could facilitate future research to evaluate and prevent the BHI in a more comprehensive way.",

    "doi": "10.1016/j.apergo.2023.104095",
    "abstract": "Warnings on the labels of hazardous household chemicals (e.g. warning pictograms and use instructions) should create risk awareness and thus encourage safe storage, handling and disposal. However, scientific findings have called into question the effectiveness of warnings to prevent accidents, albeit mostly based on consumers' self-reports. This study aimed to contribute to existing data on household chemicals and consumer safety by applying a novel observational method using virtual reality (VR). The study participants (N = 119) were observed after receiving a task to childproof a virtual apartment from various interactable neutral and hazardous objects (i.e. knives, lighters and household chemicals with and without warnings) that were placed in the virtual apartment. For the analysis, the object placement (i.e. accessible or inaccessible to the children) and the level of interaction with the objects were coded, and the observational data were supplemented with data gathered through a questionnaire. The results showed that most hazardous household chemicals were moved to spots that were inaccessible to the children without any interactions of the participants with the warnings. Instead, they used their pre-existing knowledge and intuitive strategies to judge the objects’ risks. These potentially misleading intuitive strategies should be increasingly considered in the regulation of hazardous household chemicals. This study also discussed the use and limitations of VR for the observation of human behaviour and decision making under uncertainty.",

    "abstract": "The purpose of this study was to characterize the perception of heat loss, comfort, and wetness in recreational surfers wearing wetsuits, to compare these data with changes in skin temperature reported in prior studies, and to examine the impact of wetsuit thickness, zipper location, and accessory use on thermal sensation and comfort. Following their surf session, nine-hundred and three male (n = 735) and female (n = 168) recreational surfers responded to a series of questions regarding thermal comfort/sensation, wetsuit characteristics, and surfing history. Average whole body thermal sensation rating was 0.8 ± 3.6 on a scale of −10 to +10 and average whole body thermal comfort rating was 1.5 ± 1.2, midway between “just comfortable” and “comfortable.” Overall, surfers felt coldest in their feet, hands, and head. Under their wetsuits, surfers felt the coldest, wettest, and least comfortable in their chest, lower legs, lower arms, and upper back. Wetsuit accessory use had the greatest impact on regions identified as coldest, least comfortable, and wettest. These data suggest that wetsuit design should focus on optimizing water access points and improving accessories for the feet, hands, and head.",

    "abstract": "Law enforcement officers are inherently at a high risk of injury and the loads they must carry during their occupational duties further increase their injury risk. It is unknown how different methods of carrying a law enforcement officer's load influence factors related to injury risk. This study assessed the effects of common law enforcement load carriage systems on muscular activity and postural stability while standing. Twenty-four participants performed single and dual-task (i.e. concurrent performance of cognitive tasks) standing while wearing a duty belt, tactical vest, and no load. The postural stability and muscle activity were measured and effects of condition and task examined. Dual task standing decreased postural stability and increased muscular activity. The belt and vest (7.2 kg each) increased muscle activity compared to control for the right abdominals, low back, right thigh. The duty belt resulted in less muscle activity in the right abdominals but more muscle activity in the left multifidus compared to the control. The findings indicate that common law enforcement load carriage systems increase muscular activity but do not affect postural stability. However, the lack of differences between the duty belt and tactical vest did not provide clear support for one load carriage system versus the other.",

    "abstract": "Work-related Musculoskeletal Disorders (WMSDs) account for a significant portion of worker illnesses and injuries, resulting in high costs and productivity losses to employers globally. In recent years, there has been an increased interest in the use of exoskeleton technology to reduce rates of WMSDs in industrial worksites. Despite the potential of exoskeletons to mitigate the risks of WMSDs, the required steps to properly assess and implement the technology for industrial applications are not clear. This paper proposes a framework that can help organizations successfully evaluate and adopt industrial exoskeletons. Through a focus group of industry professionals, researchers, and exoskeleton experts, and by building on existing literature, an overarching adoption framework is developed. The identified stages and tasks within the framework enable an organization to evaluate and adopt exoskeletons through a systematic approach and to identify the existing gaps in their technology adoption process. The findings also highlight the areas where further studies are needed to promote the adoption of industrial exoskeletons, including large-scale field studies and long-term monitoring.",

Autonomous vehicles (AVs) have the potential to improve the mobility of older adults with cognitive impairment; however, there are still concerns regarding AVs’ usability and accessibility in this population. Study objectives were to (1) better understand the needs and requirements of older adults with mild and moderate cognitive impairments regarding AVs, and (2) create a prototype for a holistic, user-friendly interface for AV interactions. An initial (Generation 1) prototype was designed based on the literature and usability principles. Based on the findings of phone interviews and focus group meetings with older adults and caregivers (n = 23), an enhanced interface (Generation 2) was developed. This generation 2 prototype has the potential to reduce the mental workload and anxiety of older adults in their interactions with AVs and can inform the design of future in-vehicle information systems for older adults.",

    "abstract": "Augmented reality (AR) interactions have been associated with increased biomechanical loads on the neck and shoulders. To provide a better understanding of the factors that may impact such biomechanical loads, this repeated-measures laboratory study evaluated the effects of error rates and target sizes on neck and shoulder biomechanical loads during two standardized AR tasks (omni-directional pointing and cube placing). Twenty participants performed the two AR tasks with different error rates and target sizes. During the tasks, angles, moments, and muscle activity in the neck and shoulders were measured. The results showed that the target sizes and error rates significantly affected angles, moments, and muscle activity in the neck and shoulder regions. Specifically, the presence of errors increased neck extension, shoulder flexion angles and associated moments. Muscle activity in the neck (splenius capitis) and shoulder (anterior and medial deltoids) also increased when the errors were introduced. Moreover, interacting with larger targets resulted in greater neck extension moments and shoulder abduction angles along with higher muscle activity in the splenius capitis and upper trapezius muscles. These findings indicate the importance of reducing errors and incorporating appropriate target sizes in the AR interfaces to minimize risks of musculoskeletal discomfort and injuries in the neck and shoulders.",

    "abstract": "This study captured neurophysiological, muscular, and perceptual adaptations to shoulder exoskeleton use during overhead work with competing physical-cognitive demands. Twenty-four males and females, randomly divided into control and exoskeleton groups, performed an overhead reaching and pointing task over three days without (single task) and with (dual task) a working memory task. Task performance, electromyography (EMG), neural activity, heart rate, and subjective responses were collected. While task completion time reduced for both groups at the same rate over days, EMG activity of shoulder muscles was lower for the exoskeleton group for both tasks, specifically for females during the dual task. Dual task reduced the physiological benefits of exoskeletons and neuromotor strategies to adapt to the dual task demands differed between the groups. Neuromuscular benefits of exoskeleton use were immediately realized irrespective of cognitive demand, however the perceptual, physiological, and neural adaptations with exoskeleton use were task- and sex-specific.",

    "abstract": "The production of electronic waste, also known as e-waste, has risen with the growing reliance on electronic products. To reduce negative environmental impact and achieve sustainable industrial processes, recovering and reusing products is crucial. Advances in AI and robotics can help in this effort by reducing workload for human workers and allowing them to stay away from hazardous materials. However, autonomous human motion/intention perception is a primary barrier in e-waste remanufacturing. To address the research gap, this study combined experimental data collection with deep learning models for accurate disassembly task recognition. Over 570,000 frames of motion data were collected from inertial measurement units (IMU) worn by 22 participants. A novel sequence-based correction (SBC) algorithm was also proposed to further improve the accuracy of the overall pipeline. Results showed that models (CNN, LSTM, and GoogLeNet) had an overall accuracy of 88–92%. The proposed SBC algorithm improved accuracy to 95%.",

    "abstract": "Upper-limb exoskeletons are gaining traction in industrial work environments. However, other than advertised general specifications (e.g., peak support angle), the support torque provided throughout the reach envelope is largely unknown to end users. As such, this paper describes a methodology for measuring the specific supportive torque provided by upper-limb exoskeletons. The support of four commercially available passive upper-limb exoskeletons was quantified using an isokinetic dynamometer for all support ranges and levels (n = 68). Tests were repeated four times to determine between-session reliability. Intraclass correlation coefficients demonstrated ‘Good’ to ‘Excellent’ reliability, except for one condition. Polynomial regression equations were developed for each condition to predict exoskeleton support for any upper-limb elevation angle between 10° and 180°. These equations can be used to approximate upper-limb exoskeleton support in digital human modeling assessments, or to aid selection of exoskeleton settings specific to a worker's anthropometry and work task location.",

Therefore, the purpose of the study was to propose and evaluate the influence of an ergonomic handle on upper limbs biomechanics, comfort and performance during ergometer rowing. An ergonomic irregular hexagon handle, with a 1:1.25 width/length diameters ratio, has been developed. Left upper limb kinematics and neuromuscular activity, perceived comfort and power production were monitored for 29 expert rowers. The ergonomic handle increased the perceived comfort while maintaining the overall articular stress and performance as the same level compared to the regular handle. We recommend using irregular hexagon handles with 1:1.25 ratio for ergometer rowing. Further improvements of the ergonomic handle such as an individualization based on the user's hand length may further enhance comfort and achieve better performance.",

While the concept of pressure discomfort thresholds (PDT) in humans has been applied to product design, research on the auricular concha remains scarce. In this study, we conducted an experiment to measure the PDT at six points in the auricular concha of 80 participants. Our results showed that the tragus was the most sensitive area and that gender, symmetry, and Body Mass Index (BMI)had no significant effect on PDT. Based on these findings, we generated pressure sensitivity maps of the auricular concha to aid in the optimization of in-ear wearable design.",

    "abstract": "We investigated the effect of hypoxia on the reaction time (RT) and response accuracy of pilots performing a visual choice reaction task that corresponded to the scanning of helmet mounted display (HMD) symbology. Eighteen male military pilots performed the task in a hypobaric chamber at two simulated altitudes (92 m and 4572 m) in a single-blinded repeated measures and counter-balanced design. The visual stimuli were displayed in low and high contrast and at a 30- and 50-degree field of view (FoV). We measured the pilots' RT and response accuracy. Using an eye tracker, we measured the pilot's glance time at each stimulus location. Finally, we collected subjective ratings of alertness. The results show that hypoxia increased the RT and glance time. Lowering the stimulus contrast and increasing the FoV further increased the RT, independent of hypoxia. These findings provide no evidence for hypoxia-induced changes in visual contrast sensitivity or visual field. Instead, hypoxia seemed to affect RT and glance time by reducing alertness. Despite the increased RT, the pilots maintained their accuracy on the visual task, suggesting that visual scanning of HMD symbology may be resistant to the effects of acute hypoxia.",

    "abstract": "Room-oriented immersive systems are human-scale built environments that enable collective multi-sensory immersion in virtual space. Although such systems are currently seeing increasing applications in public realms, limited understanding remains regarding how humans interact with the virtual environments displayed within. Synthesizing virtual reality ergonomics and human-building interaction (HBI) knowledge allows us to investigate these systems meaningfully. In this work, we develop a model of content analysis based on hardware components of the Collaborative-Research Augmented Immersive Virtual Environment Laboratory (CRAIVE-Lab) and the Cognitive Immersive Room (CIR) at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute. Situating ROIS as a joint cognitive system, this model consists of five categories of qualitative factors: 1) general design approach; 2) topological relationships; 3) features of tasks; 4) hardware-specific design modalities; and 5) interactive qualities. We probe the comprehensiveness of this model using existing design scenarios at the CRAIVE-Lab and the CIR featuring both application-based and experience-based designs. Through these case studies, the robustness of this model in its representation of design intention is observed, with limitations on temporal constraints. In creating this model, we establish foundations for more detailed assessments of the interactive qualities of systems alike.",

This requires a work system (i.e., SEIPS) evaluation of the technology by care team members. This study aimed to identify work system barriers and facilitators to the use of a team health IT that supports care transitions for pediatric trauma patients. We conducted an analysis on 36 interviews – representing 12 roles – collected from a scenario-based evaluation of T3. We identified eight dimensions with both barriers and facilitators in all five work system elements: person (experience), task (task performance, workload/efficiency), technology (usability, specific features of T3), environment (space, location), and organization (communication/coordination). Designing technology that meets every role's needs is challenging; in particular, when trade-offs need to be managed, e.g., additional workload for one role or divergent perspectives regarding specific features. Our results confirm the usefulness of a continuous work system approach to technology design and implementation.",

    "abstract": "We report on a series of four studies that investigated how user experience design (UXD) can improve printed educational materials (PEMs). We examined the perceived usability of an existing PEM for breast cancer screening and observed the usability problems associated with it (Study 1). We then compared a breast cancer screening PEM created by user experience designers with two other breast cancer screening PEMS, finding that the PEM based on UXD had higher perceived usability, and lower mentions of usability problems, than the other two PEMs (Study 2). We next examined the impact of individual differences in design expertise on perceived usability, this time including a PEM on cervical cancer screening as well as one on breast cancer screening (Study 3). Our concluding study (Study 4) then examined the impacts of UXD on learnability of PEM content as defined by answers to a knowledge questionnaire about screening administered before and after reading the PEM, and by intention to screen for cancer after reading the PEM. The first three studies showed that the involvement of UXD improved the perceived usability of PEMs, and Study 3 showed that designers differ in their ability to create useable PEMs. Study 4 failed to find a corresponding improvement in learnability or intention to screen when UXD was used to improve perceived usability. We conclude that a user experience design approach that incorporates graphic design can improve the perceived usability of PEMs in some situations (e.g., when the PEM material is not too lengthy or complex, and when the graphic designer is sufficiently skilled). However, we found no evidence that lack of perceived usability accounted for the failure of PEMS (found in previous research) to improve knowledge or intention to screen.",

    "abstract": "Industrial exoskeletons are developed to relieve workers’ physical demands in the workplace and to alleviate ergonomic issues associated with work-related musculoskeletal disorders. As a safe and economical alternative to empirical/experimental methods, modelling is considered as a powerful tool for design and evaluation of industrial exoskeletons. This systematic review aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of the current literature on the design and evaluation of industrial exoskeletons through modelling. A systematic study was conducted by general keyword searches of five electronic databases over the last two decades (2003–2022). Out of the 701 records initially retrieved, 33 eligible articles were included and analyzed in the final review, presenting a variety of model inputs, model development, and model outputs used in the modelling. This systematic review study revealed that existing modelling methods can evaluate the biomechanical and physiological effects of industrial exoskeletons and provide some design parameters. However, the modelling method is currently unable to cover some of the main evaluation metrics supported by experimental assessments, such as task performance, user experience/discomfort, change in metabolic costs etc. Standard guidelines for model construction and implementation, as well as validation of human-exoskeleton interactions, remain to be established.",

    "abstract": "The curved design is ubiquitous, with a vast user base due to its similarity with in shape to human physiological structure. The curved QWERTY keyboard layout was proposed for one-handed usage on smartphones with ambiguous effects. This study evaluated whether the curved QWERTY could optimize the user experience and input performance on large smartphones better than the traditional straight QWERTY layout. Eight measurements were used to evaluate the usability of each design, six suggesting curved QWERTY failed to achieve outstanding typing performance or subjective user experience, while the other two indicators showed that curved QWERTY had advantages in touch dispersion and touching offset, indicating the possible higher usability it could reach. The results also investigated the potential application of curved designs and provided insights into the optimization methods.",

    "abstract": "Occupational exoskeletons contribute to diminish the biomechanical load during manual work. However, familiarization to the use of exoskeletons is rarely considered, which may lead to failure of acceptance and implementation. In this study, ten logistic workers underwent a 5-week progressive familiarization to a passive shoulder exoskeleton, while ten workers acted as controls. Tests pre and post the familiarization applied measurements of muscle activity and kinematics of back, neck, and shoulder, perceived effort, and usability-ratings of the exoskeleton. Exoskeleton use resulted in lower muscle activity of anterior deltoid (13–39%) and upper trapezius (16–60%) and reduced perceived effort. Additionally, it induced an offset in shoulder flexion and abduction during resting position (8–10°). No conclusions on familiarization could be drawn due to low adherence to the protocol. However, the emotions of the workers towards using the exoskeleton decreased making it questionable whether the shoulder exoskeleton is suitable for use in the logistics sector.",

    "doi": "10.1016/j.apergo.2023.104082",
    "abstract": "In high-risk environments, fast and accurate responses to warning systems are essential to efficiently handle emergency situations. The aim of the present study was twofold: 1) investigating whether hand action videos (i.e., gesture alarms) trigger faster and more accurate responses than text alarm messages (i.e., written alarms), especially when mental workload (MWL) is high; and 2) investigating the brain activity in response to both types of alarms as a function of MWL. Regardless of MWL, participants (N = 28) were found to be both faster and more accurate when responding to gesture alarms than to written alarms. Brain electrophysiological results suggest that this greater efficiency might be due to a facilitation of the action execution, reflected by the decrease in mu and beta power observed around the response time window observed at C3 and C4 electrodes. These results suggest that gesture alarms may improve operators’ performances in emergency situations.",

    "abstract": "Live captioning is a challenging task that requires intense concentration to convert audio to text in real-time. Despite the importance of live captioning for accessibility, little is known about the subjective workload of captioners in this context. This study aimed to measure the subjective workload of live captioners using the NASA-TLX and to explore the factors that contribute to their mental workload. Thirty live captioners participated in the study, completing questionnaires and interviews. Results showed that the subjective mental workload of live captioners is high, similar to that of neurosurgeons. The mental workload was found to be associated with caption paraphrasing and employment status. The challenges of the job, such as the speed of speaking in live content, cognitive tasks involved in paraphrasing, the concern about poor performance, the impact on audiences, and the lack of control over job scheduling contribute to this high workload. These findings suggest the need for modulating the scheduling of the workers, having longer breaks, and working in teams rather than independently. Introducing paradigm changes for live captioning workflow, such as reducing the human effort of typing by adopting auto-generated captions, so that captioners become decision-makers or managers of generational AI systems should also be considered. By addressing these issues, we can help improve the well-being of live captioners and the quality of captions, ultimately enhancing accessibility for all.",

    "abstract": "Ventilation under garments is one of the effective solutions to alleviate heat stress in the human body, but ventilation preferences and cooling effects in different body segments at different metabolic rates are not thoroughly studied. Eighteen participants performed three metabolic intensities of cycling exercise at 30 °C, RH 35%, where five body segments underwent adjustable ventilation. The ventilation preferences, psychological and physiological responses, and energy consumption were analyzed. The preferred ventilation temperature was approximately 24.5 ± 1.9 °C and the preferred ventilation speed was 1.56 ± 0.29–1.68 ± 0.27 m s-1. At low and moderate metabolic intensities, the five body segments preferred similar ventilation temperatures. At high metabolic intensity, the back preferred lower ventilation temperatures and higher ventilation speeds than the lower limbs. Additionally, the lower back and chest are considered optimal ventilation body segments to achieve higher overall thermal comfort. This study contributes to the optimization of personal ventilated cooling garments for different metabolism scenarios.",

    "abstract": "Marksmanship performance while moving is a critical skill among tactical athletes due to the high demands of their occupational duties. Qualifications for dynamic marksmanship performance are not standardized across tactical athlete groups, which may limit comprehensive assessment of tactical athlete performance for situational awareness and adaptability to an unpredictable environment. Although static marksmanship performance provides foundational information on skills and level of ability, research is lacking on factors that influence dynamic marksmanship performance to best prepare tactical athletes for duties. The purpose of this study was to identify whether static marksmanship performance, speed of movement, load carriage, and biomechanical factors while ‘shooting on the move’ influenced dynamic marksmanship performance. Twenty-four male tactical athletes (22 active-duty Army Soldiers, two civilian SWAT operators; age: 23.83 ± 5.47 years; height: 1.80 ± 0.08 m; weight: 81.04 ± 7.87 kg) participated; final analyses did not include data from the two civilian operators to maintain sample homogeneity. Tactical athletes completed static and dynamic (‘shoot on the move’) marksmanship tasks under three load conditions: (1) no load (NL), (2) half kit (HK) of 11.34 kg, and (3) full kit (KIT) of 22.68 kg. Dynamic marksmanship was completed under three speed conditions: (1) self-selected slow speed, (2) standard speed, and (3) self-selected fast speed. Hip, knee, and ankle kinematics were collected via wireless inertial measurement units. Spatiotemporal parameters were collected via optical detection system. Marksmanship performance (accuracy) was collected via open-air acoustic target scoring and mean radial error (MRE) was calculated for both static and dynamic marksmanship tasks. Linear mixed-effects models were fit with dynamic MRE as the outcome variable with fixed effects of static MRE, load condition, speed condition, kinematics, and spatiotemporal parameters, adjusting for body mass. Alpha level was set a priori at p ≤ 0.10. The final statistical model included fixed effects of static MRE, load condition, speed condition, and time spent in double limb support. Static MRE (p < 0.01) and time spent in double limb support (p = 0.01) were significant factors. For each 1 cm increase in static MRE there was a 0.66 cm increase in dynamic MRE. For every 1% increase in time spent in double limb support while ‘shooting on the move’ there was a 0.13 cm increase in dynamic MRE. Findings from this study highlight that tactical athletes who have larger static stance MRE and spend a longer time in double limb support during a gait cycle exhibit an increase in MRE during ‘shoot on the move’ trials. Overall, dynamic shooting accuracy is not affected by lower extremity joint angles, load carriage, or speed of movement. Although strong relationships are known between gait speed, load, and lower extremity kinematics, the differences in tactical gait compared to normal gait and multi-task paradigm that likely favors marksmanship accuracy seem to present novel movement characteristics unique to occupational gait. Further investigation is warranted to identify other potential factors that may improve or worsen dynamic marksmanship performance.",

Support was the most influential factor when men selected a netball-specific shoe. A wider toe-box, more durable upper and outsole, and added cushioning and support in the midsole and insole were preferred fit, form and function features for an ideal netball-specific shoe. We recommend that manufacturers develop a range of netball-specific shoes based on the foot dimensions, playing demands and preferences of male netball players to meet men's fit and functionality requirements.",

However, little is known about PSW work tasks and their corresponding physical demand. The purpose of this study was to identify critical tasks that are physically demanding and completed frequently as identified by PSWs. Additionally, we identified contextual factors (i.e., environmental-, situational-, patient-related) that influenced physical demands. We surveyed 443 community-based PSWs working in Canada who rated the physical demand associated with client care tasks and identified contextual factors that can increase task specific physical demands. Transferring/repositioning patients, dressing, and bathing were perceived as most demanding. Patient weight and mobility influenced the level of physical demand required for most tasks. These data provide a foundation to develop physical employment standards and task specific education and training to prevent PSW injuries.",

    "abstract": "Objectives Workplace management practices targeting risk of musculoskeletal disorders (MSDs) fail to reflect evidence that risk is affected by psychosocial as well as physical hazards. To promote improved practices in occupations where MSD risk is highest, better information is needed on how psychosocial hazards, combined with physical hazards, affect risk of workers in these occupations. Methods Survey ratings of physical and psychosocial hazards by 2329 Australian workers in occupations with high MSD risk were subjected to Principal Components Analysis. Latent Profile Analysis of hazard factor scores identified different combinations of hazards to which latent subgroups of workers were typically exposed. Survey ratings of frequency and severity of musculoskeletal discomfort or pain (MSP) generated a pre-validated MSP score and its relationship with subgroup membership was analysed. Demographic variables associated with group membership were investigated using regression modelling and descriptive statistics. Results Analyses identified three physical and seven psychosocial hazard factors and three participant subgroups with differing hazard profiles. Profile group differences were greater for psychosocial than physical hazards, and MSP scores out of 60 ranged from 6.7 for the low hazard profile (29% of participants) to 17.5 for the high hazard profile (21%). Differences between occupations in hazard profiles were not large. Conclusions Both physical and psychosocial hazards affect MSD risk of workers in high-risk occupations. In workplaces such as this large Australian sample where risk management has focused on physical hazards, actions targeting psychosocial hazards may now be the most effective way to reduce risk further.",

    "abstract": "Introduction Mistaken-for-game or failure-to-identify hunting incidents refer to a hunter shooting an animal, often in haste, only to discover they have mistakenly targeted and shot a human. We sought to explore if individual differences, reaction times, peer or social pressure influence a decision to shoot quicker. Method We conducted a computer-based test involving volunteer participants (n = 202). All participants were shown videos of approaching stag, in which they had to indicate the moment they would shoot. The independent variables involved peer pressure, social media or reaction ‘influencers’ added before each video. Participants were also requested to complete individual difference surveys. Results Direct peer pressure and quick reaction test conditions presented quicker shooting times, whereas social media increased shooting times. No associations with individual differences were found. Conclusions The results suggest that hunters must ensure they minimise their distraction and influence from other people.",

    "abstract": "Despite the high prevalence of upper limb (UL) work-related musculoskeletal disorders (WRMSD) among health care workers (HCWs), little is known about their relationship with exposure to biomechanical risk factors. This study aimed to assess UL activity features under actual working conditions using two wrist-worn accelerometers. Accelerometric data were processed to obtain duration, intensity, and asymmetry of UL use in 32 HCWs during the execution of commonly performed tasks (e.g., patient hygiene, transfer, and meal distribution) within a regular shift. The results show that such tasks are characterized by significantly different patterns of UL use, in particular, higher intensities and larger asymmetries were observed respectively for patient hygiene and meal distribution. The proposed approach appears, thus, suitable to discriminate tasks characterized by different UL motion patterns. Future studies could benefit from the integration of such measures with self-reported workers’ perception to elucidate the relationship between dynamic UL movements and WRMSD.",

    "abstract": "Shooting errors have multi-faceted causes with contributing factors that include sensorimotor activity and cognitive failures. Empirical investigations often assess mental errors through threat identification, yet other cognitive failures could contribute to poor outcomes. The current study explored several possible sources of cognitive failures unrelated to threat identification with live fire exercises. Experiment 1 examined a national shooting competition to compare marksmanship accuracy, expertise, and planning in the likelihood of hitting no-shoot or unintended targets. Experts demonstrated an inverse speed/accuracy trade-off and fired upon fewer no-shoot targets than lesser skilled shooters, yet overall, greater opportunity to plan produced more no-shoot errors, thereby demonstrating an increase in cognitive errors. Experiment 2 replicated and extended this finding under conditions accounting for target type, location, and number. These findings further dissociate the roles of marksmanship and cognition in shooting errors while suggesting that marksmanship evaluations should be re-designed to better incorporate cognitive variables.",

    "abstract": "Automated Vehicle (AV) systems are expected to reduce the frequency and severity of on-road collisions. Unless drivers have an appropriate mental model for the capabilities and limitations of the automation, they may not activate the automation safely or appropriately on the road, potentially leading to a collision. As such, a training package (L4DTP) was developed to improve drivers' decisions and behaviour when activating an AV system and this was evaluated in a between-subjects simulator experiment. Drivers received no training (NT, control group), read an owner's manual (OM, experimental group 1: current training provision) or underwent the L4DTP (experimental group 2: new training programme). All drivers then experienced five scenarios in a driving simulator where they encountered road conditions which were safe and unsafe for activation. Their activation decisions, behaviour, trust in automation, workload and mental models were measured. This experiment found that drivers who read the OM or underwent the L4DTP made better activation decisions and showed better activation behaviour compared to drivers who received NT. Additionally, drivers who underwent the L4DTP found it easier, less demanding and felt under less time pressure when making their decisions, had to expend less effort to reach the same activation performance and had more appropriate and comprehensive mental models for when the automation can be activated compared to drivers who read the OM. This L4DTP can make roads safer by reducing collisions linked to poor activation decisions and behaviour. Therefore, there is the potential for a real benefit for society if this training programme is adopted into mandatory AV driver training.",

Another aim was to describe the exposed workers' proposals for risk-reducing actions, including their perceptions of potential changes in the self-assessed exposure levels and work-related pain. Several actions, targeting organizational, technical, and/or individual measures were proposed. Proposals from the ergonomists more often targeted the personal measures, whereas the workers' proposals targeted technology or organizational changes. Six companies implemented at least one of the action proposals. These action proposals were not related to evaluation metrics, nor were they evaluated. This study indicates that both ergonomists and companies need guidance on how to improve to work in a participatory process for the implementation and evaluation of risk-reducing actions, e.g., by how to better include workers’ experiences.",

    "abstract": "Modeling the quantified relationships between anthropometric/product parameters and human perceptions provides research-driven guidelines for mass customization and personalization of ergonomic products. In particular, such models are critical for designing children's eyeglasses; however, they are still underexplored. This study examined children's comfort perceptions for eyeglasses with two variables (i.e., nose pads width and temple clamping force), and established quantified linkage models between subjective human perceptions and objective 3D anthropometric/product parameters. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to quantify these relationships for ergonomic eyeglasses design. A psychological experiment with thirty child participants was performed, and our analyses showed that two eyeglasses variables significantly influenced the children's comfort perceptions; static vs. dynamic conditions caused slight differences. The mathematical trendlines and trend surfaces established by our findings can estimate perceived component-specific and overall comfort scores based on 3D anthropometric/product parameters. This also allows for calculation of parameter's allowances for sizing and grading eyeglasses while maintaining satisfactory comfort.",

Participants performed a visual search task in the physical environment while a nearby collaborative robot repeatedly extended its arm toward them. This scenario was reconstructed in two virtual environments with different levels of graphical detail. Measures of presence, task performance, workload, and anxiety were taken to determine the effect of robot motion in all three environments. Task performance decreased in response to robot motion in the physical environment, while workload and anxiety increased. This simple effect of motion was consistent across environments for measures of task performance and anxiety. However, people performed faster overall in virtual reality, and the effect of motion on workload was greatly reduced in virtual reality. Results in the virtual environments suggest that people were distracted by the sound of the robot, and that presence was affected by manipulations of immersion and coherence.",

When arranged in a sequence representing vital signs of multiple patients, spearcons may be more informative than conventional auditory alarms. However, multiple resource theory suggests that certain timeshared tasks might interfere with listeners’ ability to understand spearcons. We tested the relative interference with spearcon identification from the following ongoing tasks: (1) manual tracking, (2) linguistic detection of spoken target words, (3) arithmetic true-false judgments, or (4) an ignored background speech control. Participants were 80 non-clinicians. The linguistic task worsened spearcon identification more than the tracking task, p < .001, and more than ignored background speech, p = .012. The arithmetic task worsened spearcon identification more than the tracking task, p < .001. The linguistic task and arithmetic task both worsened performance, p = .674. However, no ongoing task affected participants’ ability to detect which patient(s) in a sequence had abnormal vital signs. Future research could investigate whether timeshared tasks affect non-speech auditory alerts.",

    "abstract": "Due to their large sizes and impediments to personnel workflows, integrating robotic technologies into the existing operating rooms (OR) is a challenge. In this study, we developed an ultra-wideband sensor-based human-machine-environment framework for layout and workflow assessments within the OR. In addition to providing best practices for use of the framework, we also demonstrated its effectiveness in understanding layout and workflow inefficiencies in 12 robotic-assisted surgeries (RAS) across 4 different surgical specialties. We found avoidable movements as the circulating nurse covers at least twice the distance of any other OR personnel before the patient cart (robot) is docked. OR areas of congestion and undesirable personnel-pair proximities across RAS phases that impose extra non-technical skill challenges were determined. Our findings highlight several implications for the added complexity of integrating robotic technologies into the OR, which can serve as drivers for objective evidence-based recommendations to combat RAS OR layout and workflow inefficiencies.",

    "abstract": "Serious games and virtual reality offer engaging learning opportunities and a cost-effective solution within an immersive and safe environment for safety training in construction. However, there have been few examples of safety training for work at heights developed using these technologies, especially commercial training. To fill this literature gap, a new VR-based safety training was developed and compared with lecture-based training across time. We conducted a quasi-experiment with a non-equivalent group design with 102 workers from six construction sites in Colombia. Learning objectives, observations from training centers, and national regulations were considered during the design of the training methods. Training outcomes were assessed using Kirkpatrick's model. We found that both training approaches were effective in improving knowledge test results and self-reported attitudes in the short-term; and risk-perception, self-reported behavior and safety climate in the long-term. In particular, participants of the VR-based training got significantly higher results in knowledge and reported higher attitudes (commitment and motivation) than participants of the lecture-based training. We suggest that safety managers and practitioners should invest in VR using serious games as an alternative to training programs based on short-term outcomes. Future work is needed to test VR for long-term outcomes.",

    "abstract": "Little research exists on how home care nursing personnel have experienced the Covid-19 pandemic. This qualitative study explores the work environment related challenges nurses and managers in home care faced during the pandemic. We discuss these challenges in relation to the Demand-Control-Support Model and reflect on how the organizational dynamics associated with them can be understood using the competing pressures model. During the pandemic, home care nurses and managers experienced both an increased workload and psychosocial strain. For managers, the increased complexity of work was a major problem. We identify three key takeaways related to sustainable crisis management: 1) to support managers’ ability to provide social support to their personnel, 2) to increase crisis communication preparedness, and 3) to apply a holistic perspective on protective gear use. We also conclude that the competing pressures model is useful when exploring the dynamics of the work environment in complex organizational contexts.",

One hundred and fifty people participated in the experiment and completed four visual detection task scenarios: (1) change detection, (2) a threat detection task, (3) a dual-task with different change detection task rates, and (4) a dual-task with different threat detection task rates. We used the largest Lyapunov exponent and correlation dimension of the EEG data and performed 0–1 tests on the EEG data. The results revealed a change in the level of nonlinearity in the EEG data corresponding to different levels of cognitive task difficulty. The differences in EEG nonlinearity measures among the studied levels of task difficulty, as well as between a single task scenario and a dual-task scenario, have also been assessed. The results increase our understanding of the nature of unmanned systems' operational requirements.",

    "abstract": "This study investigated vascular surgeon workload and its association with specific procedural drivers over different procedure types. Thirteen attending vascular surgeons (two females) were emailed a survey over a 3-month period. Data from 253 surgical procedures (118 open, 85 endovascular, 18 hybrid, and 32 venous) revealed high physical and cognitive workload among vascular surgeons. Based on the statistically significant findings and similar non-significant trends in the data (significance level of 0.01), open and hybrid vascular procedures showed higher levels of physical and cognitive workload compared to venous cases, while endovascular procedures were relatively more moderate. Additionally, the workload subscales for five subcategories of open procedures (e.g., arteriovenous access) as well as three subcategories of endovascular procedures (e.g., aortic) were compared. The granularity of the intraoperative workload drivers across various vascular procedure types and adjunct equipment could be the key to create targeted ergonomic interventions to reduce workload during vascular surgeries.",

The current study investigated whether anthropomorphic automation would engender higher trust and use, subsequently improving human-automation team performance. Participants performed a multi-element probabilistic signal detection task in which they diagnosed a hypothetical nuclear reactor as in a state of safety or danger. The task was completed unassisted and assisted by a 93%-reliable agent varying in anthropomorphism. Results gave no evidence that participants’ perceptions of anthropomorphism differed between conditions. Further, anthropomorphic automation failed to bolster trust and automation-aided performance. Findings suggest that the benefits of anthropomorphism may be limited in some contexts.",

    "abstract": "To enhance the take–over performance by human drivers of Level–2 automated vehicles (AV), we developed a design concept that presents the AV's planned trajectory as augmented reality in the windshield. We hypothesized that, even when the AV does not release a take–over request before a potential crash (i.e., silent failure), the planned trajectory would allow the driver to foresee the crash and enhance the take–over performance. To test this hypothesis, we conducted a driving–simulator experiment where participants monitored the driving status of an AV with or without the planned trajectory in the context of silent failures. The results showed that, when the planned trajectory was projected in the windshield as if it were an augmented–reality display, the crash rate decreased by 10% and the take–over response time decreased by 825 ms compared to when the planned trajectory was not provided.",

The purpose of this study was to compare lumbopelvic kinematics, discomfort, and task performance between the novel chair and traditional sitting/standing. Sixteen participants completed three separate 2-h sedentary exposures. Although participants transitioned every 3 min between sitting and standing with the novel chair, productivity was not affected. When standing in the novel chair, the lumbopelvic angles fell in between traditional sitting and standing (p < 0.01). Movement and/or postural changes that occurred with the novel chair reduced low back and leg discomfort for pain developers (PDs) (p < 0.01). All participants classified as PDs in traditional standing were non-PDs with the novel chair. This intervention was effective in reducing sedentary time without the time loss associated with desk movement.",

    "abstract": "While existing approaches for assessing passenger experience are often limited to surveys of customer satisfaction, societal and technological challenges push the railway industry to adopt a user-centric approach to the design of their service. We used the love and breakup method in a study involving N = 53 passengers making a declaration to their railway company to collect qualitative feedback on the passenger experience. The method allowed to gather personal, emotional, and contextual insights into passengers’ experiences that can inform the transportation service design process. We describe 21 factors and 8 needs influencing the passenger experience, thereby consolidating and deepening prior work in the railway context. Using the lens of user experience theories, we argue that the service should be assessed against fulfilling these needs, which can act as guiding principles regarding service improvement. The study also presents valuable insights into the love and breakup method to explore service experiences.",

This study investigated the biomechanical differences on dynamic balance during unexpected trip perturbations between safety shoes and everyday shoes. The vertical position of the whole-body center of mass (CoM) and the linear momentum of the swing leg from seven females and sixteen males were analyzed in five subsequent gait cycles. Additionally, the recovery strategies (i.e., the displacement of the foot after tripping) were classified. Wearing safety shoes, the linear momentum of the foot and whole leg increased, and the vertical position of the whole-body CoM was lower after the perturbation. Additionally, the recovery strategy when wearing safety shoes demonstrated a lower displacement of the foot. In conclusion, wearing safety shoes was found to have negative biomechanical effects when having to circumvent a trip, and this potentially increased the risk of falling.",

    "abstract": "This work aims to demonstrate entropy as a method that can be used to analyze team coordination using naturalistic team communication content. Much of team coordination happens through communication; understanding team communication is vital to better formulate and train teams for successful performance outcomes. Several decades of team communication research have led to various methods for analyzing team communication patterns. Many existing methods for team communication analysis have not been tested with naturalistic communication or only consider the frequency or flow of communication. Sliding-window entropy is used to analyze team coordination dynamics with team communication as a proxy. The resulting time series are evaluated using nonlinear dynamical systems analysis and clustering. Various team coordination patterns are identified using communication entropy at the team level. Entropy can be used to identify team communication patterns and their relation to team performance. While team coordination happens at the team level, a posteriori analysis indicates members' individual characteristics affect the overall team coordination patterns. In teams where the contribution is unequal, some members disproportionately affect the overall team coordination, which may undermine the team impact and affect team performance.",

    "abstract": "Considerable resources are invested each year into training to ensure trainees have the required competencies to safely and effectively perform their tasks/jobs. As such, it is important to develop effective training programmes which target those required competencies. One method that can be used at the start of the training lifecycle to establish the tasks and competencies that are required for a task/job and is considered an important activity to perform when developing a training programme is a Training Needs Analysis (TNA). This article presents a new TNA approach and uses an Automated Vehicle (AV) case study to demonstrate this new approach for a specific AV scenario within the current UK road system. A Hierarchical Task Analysis (HTA) was performed in order to identify the overall goal and tasks that drivers need to perform to operate the AV system safely on the road. This HTA identified 7 main tasks which were decomposed into 26 sub-tasks and 2428 operations. Then, six AV driver training themes from the literature were combined with the Knowledge, Skills and Attitudes (KSA) taxonomy to identify the KSAs that drivers need to perform the tasks, sub-tasks and operations that were identified in the HTA (training needs). This resulted in the identification of over 100 different training needs. This new approach helped to identify more tasks, operations and training needs than previous TNAs which applied the KSA taxonomy alone. As such, a more comprehensive TNA for drivers of the AV system was produced. This can be more easily translated into the development and evaluation of future training programmes for drivers of AV systems.",

    "abstract": "Previous studies suggest that performance in visual inspection and typical vigilance tasks depend on time on task and task load. European regulation mandates that security officers (screeners) take a break or change tasks after 20 min of X-ray baggage screening. However, longer screening durations could reduce staffing challenges. We investigated the effects of time on task and task load on visual inspection performance in a four-month field study with screeners. At an international airport, 22 screeners inspected X-ray images of cabin baggage for up to 60 min, while a control group (N = 19) screened for 20 min. Hit rate remained stable for low and average task loads. However, when the task load was high, the screeners compensated by speeding up X-ray image inspection at the expense of the hit rate over time on task. Our results support the dynamic-allocation resource theory. Moreover, extending the permitted screening duration to 30 or 40 min should be considered.",

    "abstract": "Brain-computer interface (BCI) technologies are progressing rapidly and may eventually be implemented widely within society, yet their risks have arguably not yet been comprehensively identified, nor understood. This study analysed an anticipated invasive BCI system lifecycle to identify the individual, organisational, and societal risks associated with BCIs, and controls that could be used to mitigate or eliminate these risks. A BCI system lifecycle work domain analysis model was developed and validated with 10 subject matter experts. The model was subsequently used to undertake a systems thinking-based risk assessment approach to identify risks that could emerge when functions are either undertaken sub-optimally or not undertaken at all. Eighteen broad risk themes were identified that could negatively impact the BCI system lifecycle in a variety of unique ways, while a larger number of controls for these risks were also identified. The most concerning risks included inadequate regulation of BCI technologies and inadequate training of BCI stakeholders, such as users and clinicians. In addition to specifying a practical set of risk controls to inform BCI device design, manufacture, adoption, and utilisation, the results demonstrate the complexity involved in managing BCI risks and suggests that a system-wide coordinated response is required. Future research is required to evaluate the comprehensiveness of the identified risks and the practicality of implementing the risk controls.",

    "abstract": "Interaction with vulnerable road users in complex urban traffic environments poses a significant challenge for automated vehicles. Solutions to facilitate safe and acceptable interactions in future automated traffic include equipping automated vehicles and vulnerable road users, such as cyclists, with awareness or notification systems, as well as connecting road users to a network of motorised vehicles and infrastructure. This paper provides a synthesis of the current literature on communication technologies, systems, and devices available to cyclists, including technologies present in the environment and on motorised interaction partners such as vehicles, and discusses the outlook for technology-driven solutions in future automated traffic. The objective is to identify, classify, and count the technologies, systems, and devices that have the potential to aid cyclists in traffic with automated vehicles. Additionally, this study aims to extrapolate the potential benefits of these systems and stimulate discourse on the implications of connected vulnerable road users. We analysed and coded 92 support systems using a taxonomy of 13 variables based on the physical, communicational, and functional attributes of the systems. The discussion frames these systems into four categories: cyclist wearables, on-bike devices, vehicle systems, and infrastructural systems, and highlights the implications of the visual, auditory, motion-based, and wireless modes of communication of the devices. The most common system was cyclist wearables (39%), closely followed by on-bike devices (38%) and vehicle systems (33%). Most systems communicated visually (77%). We suggest that interfaces on motorised vehicles accommodate cyclists with visibility all around the car and incorporate two-way communication. The type of system and the effect of communication modality on performance and safety needs further research, preferably in complex and representative test scenarios with automated vehicles. Finally, our study highlights the ethical implications of connected road users and suggests that the future outlook of transport systems may benefit from a more inclusive and less car-centred approach, shifting the burden of safety away from vulnerable road users and promoting more cyclist-friendly solutions.",

    "abstract": "We examined the impact of performing a tone counting task of varying cognitive loads and mathematical calculations simultaneously, compared to performance on the same tasks done individually. Participants performed continuous mathematical calculations, performed a high and a low cognitive load tone counting task, and also performed the math and counting tasks simultaneously. Performing the two tasks together resulted in significant dual-task interference. We also compared these results to previous studies employing the tone counting tasks with physically demanding tasks (climbing, kayaking and running). The interference between tone counting and mathematical calculations was worse than the interference between tone counting and running and kayaking. For climbing, the difference in interference was more nuanced with evidence indicating climbing uniquely asserts task prioritization. These findings have implications for operations requiring dual or multi-tasking.",

    "abstract": "Introduction While the biomechanical effects of exoskeletons are well studied, research about potential side-effects and adverse events are limited. The aim of this systematic review was to provide an overview of the side-effects and adverse events on shoulder- and back-support exoskeletons during work tasks. Methods Four in-field studies and 32 laboratory studies were included in this review, reporting on n = 18 shoulder exoskeletons, n = 9 back exoskeletons, n = 1 full body with a supernumerary arm, and n = 1 combination of shoulder and back exoskeleton. Results The most frequent side-effect reported is discomfort (n = 30), followed by a limited usability of the exoskeleton (n = 16). Other identified side-effects and adverse events were changes in muscle activity, mobility, task performance, balance and posture, neurovascular supply, gait parameters and precision. An incorrect fit of the exoskeleton and the decreased degrees of freedom are most often reported as causes of these side-effects. Two studies did not find any side-effects. This review also showed that there are differences in the occurrence of side-effects in gender, age, and physical fitness. Most studies (89%) were conducted in a laboratory setting. Most studies (97%) measured short-term effects only. Psychological and social side-effects or adverse events were not reported. Side-effects and adverse events for active exoskeletons were understudied (n = 4). Conclusion It was concluded that the evidence for side-effects and adverse events is limited. If available, it mainly consists of reports of mild discomfort and limited usability. Generalisation is limited because studies were conducted in lab settings and measured short term only, and most participants were young male workers.",

    "abstract": "Workplaces are increasingly evaluating the use of wearables for ergonomic assessment and providing biofeedback as a real-time postural intervention to improve workers’ posture. However, the effectiveness of such intervention systems has yet to be thoroughly investigated in different types of industrial tasks. This study tested the immediate effects of using vibrotactile feedback in simulated construction work tasks including lifting-lowering, shoveling, and tying rebar, to investigate the potential for such an intervention as a way to instruct workers in reducing excessive trunk flexion exposures. Fourteen male participants completed simulated work tasks with three different feedback locations, namely, no feedback, back, and wrist. The results demonstrate that the 95th, 90th, and 50th percentiles of trunk flexion angles are significantly lower for lifting-lowering and shoveling tasks when the feedback system is used. No significant postural changes were observed for the rebar tying task at any combination of percentile and feedback location. The rating of perceived exertion (RPE) for each task did not differ significantly between feedback conditions. Productivity remained the same with the feedback for lifting-lowering and rebar tying, while it was significantly reduced (4.5% of working rate reduction) in shoveling. Participants rated the wrist as the most preferred feedback location. The results of this study suggest that vibrotactile feedback has potential as an effective postural intervention for ergonomic risk factors in selected construction work tasks. Implications for the future design of real-time wearable, sensor-based vibrotactile feedback systems for postural control intervention during dynamic work tasks are discussed.",

    "abstract": "First-line managers (FLMs) have a vital role in developing stable output and organizational competitiveness through their ability to manage front-line operations in daily work. It is also well known that FLMs are strong determinants of good ergonomics and well-being for front-line staff. However, research focusing on how FLMs deal with their important role is lacking particularly regarding empirical studies. The focus here is how they deal with uncertainties and disruptive interruptions and develop more resilient performance in daily work – introduced in this article as resilient action strategies. This research uses two conceptual frameworks on resilient engineering for analysis of FLM's actions in daily work in two manufacturing companies, to explore how resilient action strategies can be organizationally supported. The study combines analysis of front-line activities with multilevel organizational support based on 30 semi-structured in-depth interviews with FLMs and support functions, 21 workshops as well as policy documents of the two companies. The analysis exemplifies how resilience engineering was enabled in practice in the organizations. The study contributes to the empirical understanding of how resilience can be organizationally supported in daily front-line work. Our results show that a developed and consistent infrastructure in companies promotes the emergence of resilient action strategies in front-line work. We propose an extended model for resilient front-line performance enhancement by including coordination as a linking aspect between the earlier suggested resilient potentials – anticipate, monitor, respond and learn. This highlights the importance of both organizational support and coordination between system levels to enable the development of resilient action strategies by FLMs.",

As expected, a reduction in peak force and impulse was observed over time as participants became more fatigued. More interestingly, pupil size was also found to decrease from trial 1 through trial 3. No changes in blink rate were found with increasing physical fatigue. While exploratory in nature, these findings add to the sparse literature exploring the use of ocular metrics in Ergonomics. They also advance the use of pupil size as a possible future alternative for physical fatigue detection.",

    "abstract": "Mental fatigue (MF) is likely to occur in the industrial working population. However, the link between MF and industrial work performance has not been investigated, nor how this interacts with a passive lower back exoskeleton used during industrial work. Therefore, to elucidate its potential effect(s), this study investigated the accuracy of work performance and movement duration through a dual task paradigm and compared results between mentally fatigued volunteers and controls, with and without the exoskeleton. No main effects of MF and the exoskeleton were found. However, when mentally fatigued and wearing the exoskeleton, movement duration significantly increased compared to the baseline condition ( β MF:Exo = 0.17, p = .02, ω2 = .03), suggesting an important interaction between the exoskeleton and one's psychobiological state. Importantly, presented data indicate a negative effect on production efficiency through increased performance time. Further research into the cognitive aspects of industrial work performance and human-exoskeleton interaction is therefore warranted.",

    "abstract": "‘Medication errors’ are a significant concern and are associated with a higher incidence of adverse events and unintentional patient harm than any other aspect of healthcare. While much research has focused on adverse medication errors, limited studies have specifically examined ‘normal’ medication delivery performance and the interactions between tasks, agents, and information within the medication administration system. This article describes a study that applied the Event Analysis of Systemic Teamwork (EAST) model to study the hospital medication administration system to identify opportunities to optimise performance and patient safety. Key findings of this study demonstrate that this is a highly complex system, comprising many social agents and a relatively closely linked series of tasks and information. However, most of the workload relies on a small proportion of healthcare professionals. Significantly, the patient has a minimal role in the medication administration system during their hospital stay. The research has shown that this approach enables mapping networks and their interdependencies to optimise the system as a whole rather than its parts in isolation.",

    "abstract": "Automated decision aids typically improve decision-making, but incorrect advice risks automation misuse or disuse. We examined the novel question of whether increased automation transparency improves the accuracy of automation use under conditions with/without concurrent (non-automated assisted) task demands. Participants completed an uninhabited vehicle (UV) management task whereby they assigned the best UV to complete missions. Automation advised the best UV but was not always correct. Concurrent non-automated task demands decreased the accuracy of automation use, and increased decision time and perceived workload. With no concurrent task demands, increased transparency which provided more information on how the automation made decisions, improved the accuracy of automation use. With concurrent task demands, increased transparency led to higher trust ratings, faster decisions, and a bias towards agreeing with automation. These outcomes indicate increased reliance on highly transparent automation under conditions with concurrent task demands and have potential implications for human-automation teaming design.",

    "abstract": "Understanding the limitations that are imposed by a disability is critical to ensure engineers develop designs that can be used by people with reduced function. Current literature lacks detail on this information for people with cervical spinal cord injuries. The purpose of this study was to investigate the reliability of a novel testing methodology to quantitatively assess the multi-directional upper limb strength of individuals in a seated position. Eleven non-disabled males and 10 males with a C4–C7 spinal cord injury completed isometric strength tests on parasagittal (XY) planes using a novel method. Multidirectional (XY) force measurements were taken at discrete points within the participant's reach envelope. Isometric force trends and analysis of the coefficients of variation were used to evaluate the novel methodology. The isometric force trends were consistent in showing a reduction in strength for people with higher injury levels. Analysis of the coefficient of variation showed that the methodology produces repeatable results with an average coefficient of variation of 18% and 19% for the right and left upper limbs, respectively. These results show that the novel testing methodology is a reliable way to gather quantitative multidirectional upper limb strength data for individuals in a seated position.",

In this study, we investigated and compared the effects of AR-, VR- and video-based training on short- and long-term objective performance measures and subjective evaluations in a manual assembly task. Our results showed that there was no difference between AR-, VR- and video-based training concerning the objective performance measures task completion time and error count. However, in the subjective evaluations VR-based training showed a significantly higher perceived task load and a lower usability rating than the AR- and video-based training regimes. An exploratory analysis additionally revealed partially better results for AR than for VR after adjusting the data for the age of the participants. Future research should further investigate the advantage of AR- and video-based methods over VR when the age and technology experience of participants are taken into account.",

Results of the study reveal, in line with hypotheses, that the graphical prototype, in contrast to the textual one, was significantly better accepted as well as faster explored and evaluated. Moreover, results support the hypothesis that the graphical sociotechnical prototype helps to build up a more accurate mental representation of the system with regard to its elements (e.g. job roles, tasks). However, no positive effect on the mental representation of the system in terms of the relations between its elements (e.g. which role performs which task?) was found. Finally, practical implications and perspectives for further development of the sociotechnical prototyping approach to envision future work systems are discussed.",

    "abstract": "Arm-support exoskeletons (ASEs) are an emerging technology with the potential to reduce physical demands during diverse tasks, especially overhead work. However, limited information is available about the effects of different ASE designs during overhead work with diverse task demands. Eighteen participants (gender-balanced) performed lab-based simulations of a pseudo-static overhead task. This task was performed in six different conditions (3 work heights × 2 hand force directions), with each of three ASEs and in a control condition (i.e., no ASE). Using ASEs generally reduced the median activity of several shoulder muscles (by ∼12–60%), changed working postures, and decreased perceived exertion in several body regions. Such effects, though, were often task-dependent and differed between the ASEs. Our results support earlier evidence of the beneficial effects of ASEs for overhead work but emphasize that: 1) these effects depend on the task demands and ASE design and 2) none of the ASE designs tested was clearly superior across the tasks simulated.",

    "abstract": "Introduction Sitting posture may contribute to spinal pain. Effects of postures on pain, sensitivity and muscle activity during computer tasks were investigated. Methods Twenty-five healthy participants, seated at a workstation without backrest, completed four, 15-min typing tasks: A)Upright with forearm-support; B)Upright without forearm-support; C)Slumped with forearm-support; D)Slumped without forearm-support. Participants rated pain every minute on a numerical rating scale (NRS). RMS-EMG was recorded from upper/lower trapezius (UT, LT), serratus anterior and anterior/middle deltoid. At baseline and after tasks, pressure pain thresholds (PPTs) were recorded bilaterally over the head, UT, and leg. Results All tasks caused clinically relevant increased NRS (≥2/10) compared to baseline (P < 0.001). NRS was higher in Task-D (P < 0.003) and lower in Task-B (P < 0.005) than others. PPTs did not change from baseline. Task-D caused higher UT and LT RMS-EMG (P < 0.02) than other tasks. Conclusion A 15-min task caused pain irrespective of posture with some causing larger changes than others.",

    "abstract": "Due to their working position, violinists are more prone to musculoskeletal pain than other instrumentalists. Playing the violin may cause increased activity in the shoulder and forearm muscles due to techniques such as vibrato (pitch variation), double-fingering (thirds), and changes in speed and volume (piano and forte). This study investigated how the different violin techniques affect muscle activity while playing scales and a music piece. Surface EMG was recorded bilaterally from the upper trapezius and forearm muscles in 18 violinists. Increased playing speed followed by playing with vibrato was the most demanding task affecting the left forearm muscles. Playing forte was the most demanding factor for the right forearm muscles. The music piece and the grand mean of all techniques showed similar workload demands. These results show that specific techniques require higher workload demands and should be considered when planning rehearsals with these techniques as a part of injury prevention.",

This study aimed to establish whether the pulling forces during a one-person 55 kg simulated casualty drag is representative of a two-person 110 kg drag. Twenty men completed up to 12 × 20m simulated casualty drags using a drag bag (55/110 kg) on a grassed sports pitch, with completion times and forces exerted measured. Completion time for the one-person 55 and 110 kg drags were 9.56 ± 1.18s and 27.08 ± 7.71s. Completion time for the 110 kg two-person drags for forwards and backwards iterations were 8.36 ± 1.23s and 11.04 ± 1.11s. The average individual force exerted during the one-person 55 kg drag was equivalent to the average individual contribution during the two-person 110 kg drag (t(16) = 3.3780, p < 0.001); suggesting a one-person 55 kg simulated casualty drag is representative of the individual contribution to a two-person 110 kg simulated casualty drag. Individual contributions can however vary during two-person simulated casualty drags.",

    "abstract": "This study characterized physical risk factors associated with injuries during a Dungeness crab harvesting task and evaluated the efficacy of a fishermen-developed ergonomic control (banger bar) in mitigating physical risk factors, including biomechanical loads in the low back, shoulders, and upper extremities, and postural instability. In a repeated-measures laboratory study, 25 healthy male participants performed manual crab harvesting tasks in five conditions: without any banger bar (control) and with 4 bars of differing heights or designs. The results showed that the ergonomic control reduced trunk and shoulder angles, L5/S1, and shoulder moments; muscle activities in low back, shoulders, and upper extremities; perceived exertion ratings; and postural sway measures. Moreover, these measures were lowest when the bar height was at 60 cm, indicating that the banger bar can reduce the risk of musculoskeletal injuries and postural instability, and that bar height is an important factor affecting these injury risk measures.",

In a standard posture change laboratory study, fifty-four participants performed visual tracking tasks in nine colour environments while in the three postures. Visual strain was measured by means of a questionnaire. The results showed that in all colour environments, the −12° head-down bed rest posture significantly affected visual tracking accuracy and visual strain. During the three postures, the participants’ visual tracking accuracy in the cyan environment was significantly higher than that in other colour environments, and their visual strain was the lowest. Overall, the study adds to our understanding of how environmental and postural factors impact on visual tracking and visual strain.",

We used data from the BAuA-Working Time Survey 2017, a representative workforce survey in Germany, and restricted the sample to 5979 full-time employees. Logistic regression analyses were conducted with in total five health complaints as dependent variables: back pain and low back pain, pain in the neck and shoulder region, general tiredness, faintness, or fatigue, physical exhaustion, and emotional exhaustion. Many employees often skipped their work breaks (29%) and experienced break interruptions (16%). Frequent skipping of work breaks was significantly positively, that is detrimentally, related to all five health complaints and frequent interruptions of work breaks also, except for neck and shoulder pain. Meal break duration was significantly negatively, that is beneficially, related to physical exhaustion.",

    "abstract": "The COVID-19 pandemic has challenged organizations to adapt under uncertainty and time pressure, with no pre-existing protocols or guidelines available. For organizations to learn to adapt effectively, there is a need to understand the perspectives of the frontline workforce involved in everyday operations. This study implemented a survey-tool to elicit narratives of successful adaptation based on the lived experiences frontline radiology staff at a large multispecialty pediatric hospital. Fifty-eight members of the radiology frontline staff responded to the tool between July and October of 2020. Qualitative analysis of the free-text data revealed five categories of themes that underpinned adaptive capacity of the radiology department during the pandemic: information flow, attitudes and initiative, new and adjusted workflows, availability and utilization of resources, and collaboration and teamwork. Enablers of adaptive capacity included timely and clear communication about procedures and policies from the leadership to frontline staff, and revised workflows with flexible work arrangements, such as remote patient screening. Responses to multiple choice questions in the tool helped identify the main categories of challenges faced by staff, factors that enabled successful adaptation, and resources used. The study demonstrates the use of a survey-tool to proactively identify frontline adaptations. The paper also reports a system-wide intervention resulting directly from a discovery enabled by the findings based on the use of RETIPS in the radiology department. In general, the tool could be used in concert with existing learning mechanisms, such as safety event reporting systems, to inform leadership-level decisions to support adaptive capacity.",

Thirty-eight members participated in this crossover-designed study with no-mat and with-mat conditions, separated by a one-week washout period. They stood on the 15 mm thick rubber anti-fatigue floor mat and on the standard antistatic polyvinyl chloride flooring surface during the surgical procedures. Subjective ratings of pain and fatigue levels were measured pre and after-surgery for each experimental condition using the Visual Analogue Scale and Fatigue-Visual Analogue Scale scales. The after-surgery pain and fatigue levels for the with-mat condition were significantly lower than the no mat condition (p < .05). Consequently, anti-fatigue floor mats are effective in decreasing pain and fatigue levels of surgical team members during surgical procedures. Using anti-fatigue mats may be a practical and easy way to prevent discomfort that is often experienced by surgical teams.",

This research was designed to test the relationship between cue utilisation and performance prior to, and following participation in an urban operations course (UOC). Methods A total of 37 participants were assessed on cue utilisation measures, course outcome and between group changes following course participation. Results A significant main effect was evident for Cue utilisation and administration, (p = 0.005), but not training group, (p = 0.54), nor between groups and point of administration, (p = 0.410). No main effect was evident between groups and training outcome, (p = 0.11). However, there was a main effect for point of administration, (p = 0.02) and training outcome and point of administration (p = 0.02). Conclusion Although cue utilisation is an essential component of perception-action tasks, cues may be more specific to the relevant training environment with limited transfer to the operational context.",

    "abstract": "Much of the thought content and mind-wandering literature examines self-reported thought content's relationship with performance criteria in limited ways. Furthermore, retrospective reports about thought content may be influenced by the quality of one's performance. We explored these method issues in a cross-sectional study of individuals competing in a trail race and an equestrian event. Our results demonstrated that self-reports of thought content differed based on the performance context: whereas runners' task-related and task-unrelated thoughts were negatively correlated, equestrians' thought content showed no relationship. Moreover, equestrians in general reported fewer task-related and task-unrelated thoughts than runners. Finally, objective performance predicted task-unrelated thought (but not task-related thought) among runners, and an exploratory mediation test suggested the effect was partially mediated by performance awareness. We discuss the applied implications of this research for human performance practitioners.",

    "abstract": "This study aimed to analyze the position of the lumbopelvic region and lumbar muscle activity in the most common breastfeeding positions. We recorded the curvatures of the lumbar spine and pelvis by means of an electrogoniometer, and the muscle activation levels of the erector spinae with electromyography, in 34 women in erect standing and breastfeeding their children in several positions. Both side lying and clutch-hold positions showed a greater degree of lumbar spine flexion compared to standing. In all sitting postures it was observed that the pelvis was placed in retroversion when compared to standing and side lying. In muscle activity, it was observed that the activation intensity of the right erector in the right side-supported side lying position was significantly lower compared to the rest of breastfeeding postures and standing. Side lying may be a better position to avoid muscle fatigue.",

    "abstract": "Stroke is characterized by high morbidity and disability, and proposing effective methods for assessing and designing rehabilitation products is an attractive topic in current research. In this study, a hand function rehabilitation aid was developed for stroke patients. Ten stroke patients and 20 healthy older people as a control group were recruited to perform a 600 s task after a 600 s resting by gripping a stick while clicking on a flashing light in an electronic insert in sequence according to a pattern. The functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) and behavioral data were collected during their rehabilitation training. Brain function was analyzed using three indicators, namely brain area activation, functional connectivity and effective connectivity, while behavioral performance was analyzed using ten indicators, such as velocity and acceleration, and correlations were made between both. Followed by proposing a quantitative assessment method based on the fusion of multiple data sources. The results showed that the developed rehabilitation tool could effectively stimulate the patient's brain and help recover their cognitive and behavioral capacities. The scientific validity of the proposed assessment approach was further confirmed by contrasting the data results of the stroke group with those of the healthy elderly group. This study has integrated brain function and behavioral data, providing a practical quantitative evaluation method of product ergonomics and data-driven product design concepts for stroke patients.",

    "title": "The development and preliminary evaluation of a clinician e-learning training platform for a neonatal sepsis risk monitor for use in ICU settings",
    "journal": "Applied Ergonomics",
    "year": "2023",
    "doi": "10.1016/j.apergo.2023.103990",
    "abstract": "Background Training clinicians on the use of hospital-based patient monitoring systems (PMS) is vital to mitigate the risk of use errors and of frustration using these devices, especially when used in ICU settings. PMS training is typically delivered through face-to-face training sessions in the hospital. However, it is not always feasible to deliver training in this format to all clinical staff given some constraints (e.g., availability of staff and trainers to attend in-person training sessions and the costs associated with face-to-face training). Objective The literature indicates that E-learning has the potential to mitigate barriers associated with time restrictions for trainers and trainees and evidence shows it to be more flexible, and convenient for learners in healthcare settings. This study aimed to develop and carry out a preliminary evaluation via a case study of an e-learning training platform designed for a novel neonatal sepsis risk monitor system (Digi-NewB). Methods A multi-modal qualitative research case study approach was used, including the analysis of three qualitative data sources: (i) audio/video recordings of simulation sessions in which participants were asked to operate the system as intended (e.g., update the clinical observations and monitor the sepsis risk), (ii) interviews with the simulation participants and an attending key opinion leader (KOL), who observed all simulation sessions, and (iii) post-simulation survey. Results After receiving ethical approval for the study, nine neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) nurses completed the online training and participated in the simulation and follow-up interview sessions. The KOL was also interviewed, and seven out of the nine NICU nurses answered the post-simulation survey. The video/audio analysis of the simulations revealed that participants were able to use and interpret the Digi-NewB interface. Interviews with simulation participants and the KOL, and feedback extracted from the survey, revealed that participants were overall satisfied with the training platform and perceived it as an efficient and effective method to deliver medical device training. Conclusions This study developed an online training platform to train clinicians in the use of a critical care medical device and carried out a preliminary evaluation of the platform via a case study. The e-learning platform was designed to supplement and enhance other training approaches. Further research is required to evaluate the effectiveness of this approach.",

    "abstract": "Identifying and characterizing the factors that affect presence in virtual environments has been acknowledged as a critical step to improving Virtual Reality (VR) applications in the built environment domain. In the search to identify those factors, the research objective was to test whether three-dimensional perception affects presence in virtual environments. A controlled within-group experiment utilizing perception and presence questionnaires was conducted, followed by data analysis, to test the hypothesized unidirectional association between three-dimensional perception and presence in two different virtual environments (non-immersive and immersive). Results indicate no association in either of the systems studied, contrary to the assumption of many scholars in the field but in line with recent studies on the topic. Consequently, VR applications in architectural design may not necessarily need to incorporate advanced stereoscopic visualization techniques to deliver highly immersive experiences, which may be achieved by addressing factors other than depth realism. As findings suggest that the levels of presence experienced by users are not subject to the display mode of a 3D model (whether immersive or non-immersive display), it may still be possible for professionals involved in the review of 3D models (e.g., designers, contractors, clients) to experience high levels of presence through non-stereoscopic VR systems provided that other presence-promoting factors are included.",

    "abstract": "With the emergence of enormous amounts of data, numerous ways to visualize such data have been used. Bar, circular, line, radar and bubble graphs that are ubiquitous were investigated for their effectiveness. Fourteen participants performed four types of evaluations: between categories (cities), within categories (transport modes within a city), all categories, and a direct reading within a category from a graph. The representations were presented in random order and participants were asked to respond to sixteen questions to the best of their ability after visually scanning the related graph. There were two trials on two separate days for each participant. Eye movements were recorded using an eye tracker. Bar and line graphs show superiority over circular and radial graphs in effectiveness, efficiency, and perceived ease of use primarily due to eye saccades. The radar graph had the worst performance. “Vibration-type” fill pattern could be improved by adding colors and symbolic fills. Design guidelines are proposed for the effective representation of data so that the presentation and communication of information are effective.",

Eye strain, body discomfort, typing performance, upper trapezius (UT) activation amplitude and variability, and neck posture were analyzed for time, condition, and sex effects. No significant effects of condition were observed on the dependent measures evaluated. Discomfort increased over time (neck/shoulder: p < .001), more so in females (eye strain: p < .001). Females’ UT activation amplitude was negatively correlated to eye strain in the placebo condition (p = .05).",

    "abstract": "Interference between a walking task (target speeds on a self-paced treadmill) and dual visual and tactile-visual response time task was investigated. Ambulatory dual-task scenarios reveal how attention is divided between walking and additional tasks, but the impact of walking speed and dual-task modality on gait characteristics and dual-task performance is unclear. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effect of visual and tactile-visual dual-task on gait performance. Participants (n=15) targeted four speeds (0.5, 1.0, 1.3, and 1.5 m/s) on a self-paced treadmill with a visual speed indicator (a green region centered at the target speed). Participants completed the same speed profile on the treadmill without (Self-Paced) and with a response time dual task (Self-Paced with Dual Task) requiring finger-tap responses to go/no-go cues. Six gait characteristics were calculated: proportion of time in the desired speed green region (GTP), speed ratio (ratio of mean to target speed), time to green region after target speed change (NRT), normalized stride width (NSW), normalized stride length (NSL), and stride time (ST). Both stride length and width were normalized by participant leg length. Lower GTP and greater speed ratio at slower speeds during dual tasking indicate speed-dependent changes in gait characteristics. Changes in NSL and ST were more affected by speed than dual task. These findings support that when speed is a parameter that is tracked, participants do not universally decrease speed in the presence of a dual task. These findings can support the decisions made when designing new wearable technologies that support navigation, communication, and mobility.",

    "abstract": "The importance of Safety Management Systems (SMS) to the railway industry is underlined by the fact that all organisations operating on UK railways are required by law to have one. Analysing SMSs can provide a reliable systemic tool to identify hazards and weaknesses within complex systems like the railway, making it possible to significantly increase safety, reducing the odds of near misses and accidents. However, there is little empirical research evidence to determine the impact on safety of a structured SMS. The current paper describes two studies which use Bayesian Belief Networks (BBN) to conceptualise SMSs and their impact on front-line performance. The paper presents the usefulness of BBNs to compare complex systems and reconcile cultural differences within the railway industry, identifying factors that are deemed vital within Italy and Britain. The two studies allowed us to identify the most influential factors within a SMS and how they interact with each other, as well as the strength of the identified relationships. A BBN is particularly useful in estimating how changing some of the node states (e.g., by making safety leadership present) affected the other factors. The current study showed that safety leadership has an impact on the SMSs of the British and Italian railway industries.",

    "abstract": "The study addressed an important knowledge gap in the literature by co-designing a model for OHS management systems inclusive of workers who work-from-home, with a focus on psychosocial risks. This qualitative research study utilised a series of co-design focus groups involving Australian regulators, health and safety managers and practitioners, senior managers, middle managers and workers who work-from-home, to better understand the types of measures that organisations can apply to improve their health and safety management systems. Using a systems approach, consideration was given to the organisation of the remote working system, the home-work interface for remote workers, the competencies of managers and employees in regard to their occupation health and safety (OHS) responsibilities, and the complexity of identifying, reporting and monitoring psychosocial hazards for employees working from home. The study identified a need for tools designed to support both managers and workers in promoting psychologically safe working from home.",

    "abstract": "Current advances in airplane cockpit design and layout are often driven by a need to improve the pilot's awareness of the aircraft's state. This involves an improvement in the flow of information from aircraft to pilot. However, providing the aircraft with information on the pilot's state remains an open challenge. This work takes a first step towards determining the pilot's state based on biosensor data. We conducted a simulator study to record participants' electrodermal activity and gaze behavior, indicating pilot state changes during three distinct flight phases in an instrument failure scenario. The results show a significant difference in these psychophysiological measures between a phase of regular flight, the incident phase, and a phase with an additional troubleshooting task after the failure. The differences in the observed measures suggest great potential for a pilot-aware cockpit that can provide assistance based on the sensed pilot state.",

Data were collected from forty-eight adults across varied office task scenarios (i.e., sending an email, setting up a timer/reminder, and searching for a phone number/address) and noise types (i.e., silence, non-verbal noise, and verbal noise). The baseline for this study is measured without the use of an IVA. Significant differences in performance and workload were found on both objective and subjective measures. In particular, verbal noise emerged as the primary factor affecting performance using an IVA. Task performance was dependent on the task scenario and noise type. Subjective ratings found that participants preferred to use IVA for less complex tasks. Future work can focus more on the effects of tasks, demographics, and learning curves. Furthermore, this work can help guide IVA system designers by highlighting factors affecting performance.",

In a repeated-measures laboratory study, each of the 20 participants performed a series of AR tasks with and without a commercially-available upper-limb exoskeleton. During the AR tasks, muscle activity (anterior, middle, posterior deltoid, and upper trapezius), shoulder joint postures/moment, and self-reported discomfort were collected. The results showed that the exoskeleton significantly reduced muscle activity in the upper trapezius and deltoid muscle groups and self-reported discomfort. However, the shoulder postures and task performance measures were not affected by the exoskeleton during the AR interactions. Given the significant decrease in muscle activity and discomfort without compromising task performance, a passive exoskeleton can be an effective ergonomic control measure to reduce the risks of developing musculoskeletal discomfort or injuries in the shoulder regions.",

    "abstract": "Pedestrians’ trust in automated vehicles (AVs) needs to be analyzed and deconstructed to update it from its current broad concept into several lower-level attributes for assessment and measurement. In this study, we have employed virtual reality (VR) and scenario-based interviews to examine the trust of pedestrians toward AVs, based on the attributes of trust and trustworthiness. A hybrid approach of inductive and deductive thematic analysis of the responses of 36 participants was undertaken. Eight such attributes emerged from the analysis, including statistical reliability and dependability, competence, predictability, familiarity, authority/subversion, liberty/oppression, care/harm, and sanctity/degradation. The first four are objective attributes concerning automation trustworthiness and human trust in automation, while the remaining four are subjective attributes, analogous to properties of human morality. The findings of this study provide an empirical grounding for trust theories. Specifically, we have highlighted the importance of subjective qualities in constituting pedestrian-AV trust, including “automation morality” and “care/harm”.",

    "abstract": "Introduction Physiological limits imposed by vest-borne loads must be defined for optimal performance monitoring of the modern dismounted warfighter. Purpose To evaluate how weighted vests affect locomotion economy and relative cardiometabolic strain during military load carriage while identifying key physiological predictors of exhaustion limits. Methods Fifteen US Army soldiers (4 women, 11 men; age, 26 ± 8 years; height, 173 ± 10 cm; body mass (BM), 79 ± 16 kg) performed four incremental walking tests with different vest loads (0, 22, 44, or 66% BM). We examined the effects of vest-borne loading on peak walking speed, the physiological costs of transport, and relative work intensity. We then sought to determine which of the cardiometabolic indicators (oxygen uptake, heart rate, respiration rate) was most predictive of task failure. Results Peak walking speed significantly decreased with successively heavier vest loads (p < 0.01). Physiological costs per kilometer walked were significantly higher with added vest loads for each measure (p < 0.05). Relative oxygen uptake and heart rate were significantly higher during the loaded trials than the 0% BM trial (p < 0.01) yet not different from one another (p > 0.07). Conversely, respiration rate was significantly higher with the heavier load in every comparison (p < 0.01). Probability modeling revealed heart rate as the best predictor of task failure (marginal R2, 0.587, conditional R2, 0.791). Conclusion Heavy vest-borne loads cause exceptional losses in performance capabilities and increased physiological strain during walking. Heart rate provides a useful non-invasive indicator of relative intensity and task failure during military load carriage.",

    "abstract": "Future user acceptance will be a requirement for the AVs to accomplish their estimated safety benefits, highlighting the importance of acceptable driving behaviour. This study aims to investigate the parameters that affect the acceptability of highly automated overtaking. 237 respondents participated in a video based online survey, rating different motorway flying overtaking scenarios based on their preferences. The scores were analysed using a variety of methods (statistical tests, Principal Component Analysis, Linear Mixed Models). Long pull-out distances and manoeuvre duration values, as well as lower speeds were preferred by the participants, with some limited impact of the driving situation. Overall, behaviour simulating an average, cautious human driver is likely to positively influence acceptability and suggests the value of further research on context-adaptive automated driving to account for subjective risk perception. These findings can contribute towards user-centred systems that assist or autonomously perform overtaking manoeuvres, supporting their uptake and thus the realisation of their safety benefits.",

DM in general was assessed by nursing faculty using a clinical judgement rubric, and dichotomously based on recognition of the stroke or not. Results Data from eight experienced nurses was examined. For the nurses who recognized the stroke, visual attention was focused on the vital sign monitor and patient's head, which suggest those locations were consistently examined for correct decision-makers. Conclusions Dwell time on general AOIs was associated with poorer DM, which may reflect poorer pattern recognition. Eye-tracking metrics may be effective to objectively assess nurse DM.",

However, limited research has been done to discuss the role of emotional expressions and contextual cues in influencing anthropomorphic trustworthiness, especially from the design perspective. To address this research gap, the current study designed a specific robot prototype and conducted two lab experiments to explore the effect of emotional expressions and contextual cues on trustworthiness via a combination of subjective ratings and physiological measures. Results showed that: 1) positive (vs. negative) emotional expressions enjoyed a higher level of anthropomorphic trustworthiness and visual attention; 2) regulatory fit was expanded in parasocial interaction and worked as a prime to activate anthropomorphic trustworthiness for social robots. Theoretical contributions and design implications were also discussed in this study.",

In a repeated-measures laboratory experiment, 20 healthy male participants performed 10-min drilling tasks with and without two passive upper-limb exoskeletons (VEX and Airframe). During the tasks, muscle activity in eight muscles (upper limb - upper trapezius, middle deltoid, biceps brachii, triceps brachii; low back - erector spinae; lower limb - rectus femoris, biceps femoris, tibialis anterior) was collected using electromyography as a physical exertion measure. Subjective discomfort rating in six body parts was measured using the Borg's CR-10 scale. The results showed that muscle activity (especially in the upper-limb muscles) was significantly decreased by 29.3–58.1% with both exoskeletons compared to no exoskeleton condition. The subjective discomfort ratings showed limited differences between the conditions. These findings indicate that passive upper-limb exoskeletons may have potential as an effective intervention to reduce muscular loading and physical exertion during overhead work.",

    "abstract": "This study contributes towards a threshold for the onset of discomfort stemming from vibration that is transmitted to the human body by means of impulsive wave slamming in dynamic shipping environments. Wave slamming is a random, violent, non-linear event. Subjective and objective data were collected from two research voyages on a slamming-prone vessel. Full-scale vertical acceleration measurements were conducted near work and accommodation areas on the vessel. A daily diary survey was used to gather human responses among passengers. In addition, instantaneous slamming vibration comfort ratings were obtained by observers on the ship Bridge during a test sequence that purposefully induced slamming. The results indicate that two different approaches converged to the same VD V 1hr comfort threshold (0.41 m / s 1.75 and 0.43 m / s 1.75 ), which corresponds to the limit where 50% of respondents indicated discomfort. A similar analysis using the r . m . s . metric converged to an identical threshold (0.03 m / s 2 ), irrespective of the accumulated time of assessment.",

    "abstract": "High movement velocities are among the primary risk factors for work-related musculoskeletal disorders (MSDs). Ergonomists have commonly used two methods to calculate angular movement velocities of the upper arms using inertial measurement units (accelerometers and gyroscopes). Generalized velocity is the speed of movement traveled on the unit sphere per unit time. Inclination velocity is the derivative of the postural inclination angle relative to gravity with respect to time. Neither method captures the full extent of upper arm angular velocity. We propose a new method, the gyroscope vector magnitude (GVM), and demonstrate how GVM captures angular velocities around all motion axes and more accurately represents the true angular velocities of the upper arm. We use optical motion capture data to demonstrate that the previous methods for calculating angular velocities capture 89% and 77% relative to our proposed method.",

    "abstract": "The dynamic work environments of tactical athletes are difficult to replicate in a laboratory. Accelerometers and inertial measurement units provide a way to characterize movement in the field. This systematic review identified how accelerometers and inertial measurement units are currently being used to quantify movement patterns of tactical athletes. Seven research and military databases were searched, producing 26,228 potential articles with 78 articles included in this review. The articles studied military personnel (73.1%), firefighters (19.2%), paramedics (3.8%), and law enforcement officers (3.8%). Accelerometers were the most used type of sensor, and physical activity was the primarily reported outcome variable. Seventy of the studies had fair or poor quality. Research on firefighters, emergency medical services, and law enforcement officers was limited. Future research should strive to make quantified movement data more accessible and user-friendly for non-research personnel, thereby prompting increased use in tactical athlete groups, especially first responder agencies.",

First, textual analysis showed that IRs' accuracy significantly decreased six months after the 1st-TS. Based on this result, the refresher TS was designed and conducted with 64 residents. To verify the refresher TS’ effectiveness, IRs after the 1st-TS, six months later, and after the refresher TS were compared via text analysis. The results showed that the refresher TS restored the description rate of patient's background, safety check procedures, original work procedures, information on equipment used, reporter's actions, and post-incident response. The questionnaire was also administered and showed that the refresher TS contributed to residents' motivation to learn about IRs. In conclusion, the refresher TS contributed to sustaining the effect of the 1st-TS on accurately describing IRs.",

    "doi": "10.1016/j.apergo.2023.103984",
    "abstract": "Level crossing safety is a well-researched safety issue worldwide, but little attention has been placed on the safety benefits of using train horns when a train approaches a level crossing. Given train horns' adverse effects on the health and well-being of residents living near rail tracks, the use of train horns must be beneficial to safety. The current study sought to determine in a laboratory environment whether road users (N = 31) can detect the range of train horns observed in Australia in terms of loudness and duration, using high-definition audio recordings from railway crossings. A repeated measures design was used to evaluate the effects of key factors likely to influence the detectability of train horns, including, visual and auditory distractive tasks, hearing loss and environmental noise (crossing bells). Train horn detectability was assessed based on participants' accuracy and reaction times. Results indicated the duration of the train horn had the most influential effect on the detectability of train horns, with short-duration train horns less likely to be detected. The presence of bells at a crossing was the second most important factor that limited train horn detection. Train horn loudness also affected detectability: faint blasts were less likely to be noticed, while loudest blasts were more likely to be noticed. However, loud horns reduced the ability to detect the side from which the train was approaching and may result in longer times to detect the train, in the field. The auditory distractive task reduced the train horn detection accuracy and increased reaction time. However, the visual distractive task and medium to severe hearing loss were not found to affect train horn detection. This laboratory study is the first to provide a broad understanding of the factors that affect the detectability of Australian train horns by road users. The findings from this study provide important insights into ways to reduce the use and modify the practice to mitigate the negative effects of train horns while maintaining the safety of road users.",

The goal of this study is to provide an overview of existing literature regarding emotions and perceptions from older people related to the outdoor built environment. A scoping review was performed using empirical studies in 12 scientific databases in a fourteen-year period (2007–2021) involving people at least 60 years old and outdoor built environment perceptions. Collected evidence identified 52 papers following the PRISMA procedure. Studies reported basic emotions (e.g., fear, joy) and space perceptions (e.g., walkability, accessibility) regarding the outdoor built environment as sidewalks, streets, and greenery. Our study reinforces the importance of analyzing older people perceptions regarding the outdoor built environment so that architects, urban planners, and decision makers have information to design solutions that fit older people needs.",

Participants were randomized into one of four groups, differing in agent positivity and frequency of interaction, and completed both a pattern recognition task and transfer task with the aid of the same computer agent. Subjective trust ratings, performance data, compliance, and agreement were collected and analyzed. Results demonstrated that frequency of positive and negative interactions did have an impact on user trust and trust resilience after a major error. Additionally, it was shown that relationship equity has an impact on user trust and trust resilience.

    "doi": "10.1016/j.apergo.2022.103955",
    "abstract": "The extra effort of healthcare professionals to provide care is a manifestation of resilient performance (RP), usually going unnoticed due to successful outcomes. However, it is not clear how the human cost of RP can be assessed. This study addresses this gap by investigating the relationships between proxies of RP and its human cost. The proposed approach was tested in a 29-bed intensive care unit (ICU). The centrality of each professional in the advice-seeking social network was considered as the proxy of their contribution to system resilience. A resilience score was calculated for each professional as the product of three network centrality metrics (in-degree, closeness, and betweenness) and two non-network attributes, namely their availability and reliability. Professionals' burnout was the proxy of the human cost of RP, assessed through the Maslach Burnout Inventory, composed of 22 items divided into a triad of emotional exhaustion, depersonalization, and personal accomplishment. Both questionnaires, for social network analysis and burnout, included socio-demographic questions and were answered by 99.0% of the professionals. Results indicated a weak correlation between emotional exhaustion and the resilience score (p = 0.008). This score was also weakly correlated with working overtime (p = 0.005). Overall, findings provided initial evidence that RP as measured in our study matters to burnout, and that the two proxies are exemplars of applying a more general reasoning that might be valid for other proxies.",

    "abstract": "In the present study we evaluated the relationship between human vibrational comfort and psychophysiological processes. We exposed twenty-one participants to three levels of whole-body vibration at low intensity inside a full-scale mock-up of a ship cabin. Autonomic Nervous System (ANS) activity, mood and well-being state during each level of vibration exposure were measured. We found that a positive affective state determined greater changes in ANS activity in response to vibration variations compared to a negative affective condition. Furthermore, we found that variations of the vibration intensity did not always determine variations of the comfort experience at physiological and psychological level. The relevance of our findings is a challenge for comfort design research showing a gap between guidelines for comfort design and evidence based on psychophysiological responses to environmental stimulation.",

    "abstract": "Conventionally, trunk range of motion (TROM) requires manual measurement by an external health professional with a general-purpose goniometer. This study aims to propose a convenient test protocol to assess TROM based on a single wearable sensor and to further investigate the relationship between TROM and fall risk of older people. We first explored the optimal sensor position by comparing TROMs from four representative locations (T1, T12, L5 and sternum) and optical motion capture system (golden reference). A follow-up experiment was conducted to evaluate the relationship between TROM and fall risk. The results showed that T12 achieved the minimum root mean square error (3.8 ± 2.2°) against the golden reference and the non-faller group had significantly higher TROMs than the faller group. These findings suggest that the newly proposed protocol is convenient yet valid and TROM can be a promising indicator of fall risk in older people.",

In this case study, we analyzed the SHIELD Enterprise, a disaster intervention development team that developed and deployed a diagnostic testing system for community surveillance and diagnosis to respond to the COVID-19 infectious disease outbreak. We conducted interviews with 27 team members to identify the work system barriers and facilitators they experienced and to analyze the influence on team performance to inform sociotechnical system design for future teams. We identified 215 barriers and 238 facilitators, which we inductively categorized into eight overarching groups, i.e., categories, that included ambiguity, team processes, technology, design and project requirements, knowledge and expertise, organization, task work and environment. Our findings led to eight sociotechnical system design principles to support future disaster intervention development teams.",

    "doi": "10.1016/j.apergo.2022.103938",
    "abstract": "Ramps are one of the main solutions for people with motor disabilities to overcome small disparities in height, both across cities and inside buildings. To permit the autonomous use of ramps, they must satisfy specific requisites. In particular, the slopes must not be excessively steep but adhere to the values identified in regulations and validated by scientific research. In historic cities, however, the placement of ramps is often complicated by a lack of space required for their length. In Venice, in particular, its urban morphology often makes it impossible to conform to the required slopes. For this reason, a specific ramp, known as “stepped ramp”, has been designed by technicians of the City of Venice with a steeper slope than allowed by regulations. It offers many possibilities but even some key problems. This paper presents a scientific analysis of ten different ramps to evaluate the structures that directly influence the feeling of comfort or discomfort of a wheelchair user with assistance, as well as the coefficients of friction of the different flooring surfaces. This study aims to understand objectively if this solution is efficient to improve accessibility in some specific circumstances, where it is not possible to follow the regulations using flat ramps.",

    "abstract": "Innovative input devices are being available for in-vehicle information systems (IVISs). While they have the potential to provide enjoyable driving by enabling drivers to perform non-driving related tasks (NDRTs) in more natural ways, the associated distracting effects should be paid with more attention. The purpose of this exploratory study was to compare the effects of three novel input modalities, i.e., touchscreen-based interaction (TBI), speech-based interaction (SBI), and gesture-based interaction (GBI), on driving performance and driver visual behaviors. Moreover, we examined if the influence of different modalities would be moderated by the difficulty level of NDRTs. A total of 36 participants were invited to a simulated driving experiment where they were randomly assigned to one of the four groups (TBI, GBI, SBI or baseline) and completed three driving trials. The results showed that TBI led to the worse driving performance, as indicated by the significantly prolonged reaction time, reduced minimum time-to-collision, and increased variations in both longitudinal and lateral vehicle control. The deteriorated driving performance could be attributed, at least partially, to the intense visual demand induced by looking towards the touchscreen, as indicated by more and longer off-the-road glances. The adverse impacts of GBI were relatively smaller, but it still posed great crash risk by leading to a shorter minimum time-to-collision and less stable vehicle control compared to the baseline. SBI, although not completely equivalent to the baseline group, showed the minimum influence on driving and visual performance. Only very few interaction effects were found, suggesting that the effects of modality were quite robust across different NDRTs. It was concluded that SBI and GBI provided safer alternatives to in-vehicle interaction than TBI.",

Medline, Embase, Web of Science, Cochrane Central and PsycINFO were searched for studies on associations between work-related physical or psychosocial risk factors and the occurrence of elbow disorders. Two independent reviewers selected eligible studies and assessed risk of bias (RoB). Results of studies were synthesized narratively. We identified 17 new studies and lateral epicondylitis was the most studied disorder (13 studies). Five studies had a prospective cohort design, eight were cross-sectional and four were case-control. Only one study had no items rated as high RoB. Combined physical exposure indicators (e.g. physical exertion combined with elbow movement) were associated with the occurrence of lateral epicondylitis. No other consistent associations were observed for other physical and psychosocial exposures. These results prevent strong conclusions regarding associations between work-related exposures, and the occurrence of elbow disorders.",

    "abstract": "Many cyberattacks begin with a malicious email message, known as spear phishing, targeted at unsuspecting victims. Although security technologies have improved significantly in recent years, spear phishing continues to be successful due to the bespoke nature of such attacks. Crafting such emails requires attackers to conduct careful research about their victims and collect personal information about them and their acquaintances. Despite the widespread nature of spear-phishing attacks, little is understood about the human factors behind them. This is particularly the case when considering the role of attack personalization on end-user vulnerability. To study spear-phishing attacks in the laboratory, we developed a simulation environment called SpearSim that simulates the tasks involved in the generation and reception of spear-phishing messages. Using SpearSim, we conducted a laboratory experiment with human subjects to study the effect of information availability and information exploitation end-user vulnerability. The results of the experiment show that end-users in the high information-availability condition were 2.97 times more vulnerable to spear-phishing attacks than those in the low information-availability condition. We found that access to more personal information about targets can result in attacks involving contextually meaningful impersonation and narratives. We discuss the implications of this research for the design of anti-phishing training solutions.",

The aim of this study is to explore the perceptions of prehospital clinicians of wearing body armour.Focus groups were conducted until theoretical saturation was reached, utilising hermeneutic phenomenology.Problems with the comfort, safety, time, hygiene, coverage, and female fit of armour were identified. Clinicians feel hot in summer, time to respond to scenes is increased and the fit for females is poor.Consideration should be given to sourcing specific female-fit armour and to the interoperability with the rest of the protective clothing. A redesign of uniform could provide greater flexibility to mitigate some of the issues.",

This study assessed coefficient of friction (COF) across resilient flooring products specific to conditions relevant to healthcare. The COF for eleven resilient flooring surfaces were tested in their dry condition and under six contaminant conditions. Data was analyzed using ANOVA and principal component analysis. The COF was strongly influenced by the contaminant condition (p < 0.001) with hand sanitizer and canola oil having the lowest COF values. COF was also influenced by the flooring product (p < 0.001) although to a lesser extent than the contaminant condition. The contaminants differentially affected the friction performance across the flooring products (interaction effect p < 0.001). These effects were described by the first two principal components. This study reveals high slipping potential for certain contaminants on resilient flooring and that flooring influences friction performance in contaminant-specific ways.",

    "abstract": "Work-related stress has long been recognized as an essential factor affecting employees' health and wellbeing. Repeated exposure to acute occupational stressors puts workers at high risk for depression, obesity, hypertension, and early death. Assessment of the effects of acute stress on workers' wellbeing usually relies on subjective self-reports, questionnaires, or measuring biometric and biochemical markers in long-cycle time intervals. This study aimed to develop and validate the use of a multiparameter wearable armband for continuous non-invasive monitoring of physiological states. Two worker populations were monitored 24 h/day: six loggers for one day and six ICU nurses working 12-hr shifts for one week. Stress responses in nurses were highly correlated with changes in heart rate variability (HRV) and pulse transit time (PTT). A rise in the low-to high-frequency (LF/LH) ratio in HRV was also coincident with stress responses. HRV on workdays decreased compared to non-work days, and PTT also exhibited a persistent decrease reflecting increased blood pressure. Compared to loggers, nurses were involved in high-intensity work activities 45% more often but were less active on non-work days. The wearable technology was well accepted by all worker participants and yielded high signal quality, critical factors for long-term non-invasive occupational health monitoring.",

    "abstract": "Background Ensuring that pool lifeguards develop the skills necessary to detect drowning victims is challenging given that these situations are relatively rare, unpredictable and are difficult to simulate accurately and safely. Virtual reality potentially provides a safe and ecologically valid approach to training since it offers a near-to-real visual experience, together with the opportunity to practice task-related skills and receive feedback. As a prelude to the development of a training intervention, the aim of this research was to establish the construct validity of virtual reality drowning detection tasks. Method Using a repeated measures design, a total of 38 qualified lifeguards and 33 non-lifeguards completed 13 min and 23 min simulated drowning detection tasks that were intended to reflect different levels of sustained attention. During the simulated tasks, participants were asked to monitor a virtual pool and identify any drowning targets with accuracy, response latency, and dwell time recorded. Results During the simulated scenarios, pool lifeguards detected drowning targets more frequently and spent less time than non-lifeguards fixating on the drowning target prior to the drowning onset. No significant differences in response latency were evident between lifeguards and non-lifeguards nor for first fixations on the drowning target. Conclusion The results provide support for the construct validity of virtual reality lifeguarding scenarios, thereby providing the basis for their development and introduction as a potential training approach for developing and maintaining performance in lifeguarding and drowning detection. Application This research provides support for the construct validity of virtual reality simulations as a potential training tool, enabling improvements in the fidelity of training solutions to improve pool lifeguard competency in drowning detection.",

    "abstract": "Improved safety and traffic efficiency are among the proclaimed benefits of automated driving functions. In many scenarios, traffic safety and efficiency can be somewhat contradictory, especially in the perception of a user. In order for potential users to accept the automated system, it is necessary to find the optimal system configuration. Therefore, it is important to understand how the factors underlying acceptance develop and interact. In this study, seven safety distances of an automated parking system were implemented resulting in parking manoeuvres of varying efficiency (in terms of required moves). Participants experienced each configuration twice and rated their perceived safety and perceived usefulness. The results show that maximizing safety distances results in high perceived safety, yet also a diminished perceived usefulness due to reduced efficiency. On the other hand, maximum efficiency leads to a lower perceived safety and thus, a reduced rating of perceived usefulness. Furthermore, in some participants, perceived safety increased gradually, while for others, a threshold effect could be observed. The results demonstrate that the specification of a sole system characteristic can have multiple effects. These have to be considered to maximize acceptance.",

    "abstract": "To design high-quality head/face-related products for children, it is essential to be able to construct 3D geometric models of their head growth patterns and variations. However, compared to 3D anthropometric analysis of adults' heads, this is still an underexplored research area. This study developed a framework for modeling the 3D geometric growth patterns and sex-specific variations of children's heads. To analyze these variations, the entire heads of 793 children (395 females and 398 males) ages 5–17 were scanned, and one global and two sex-specific statistical shape models (SSMs) were constructed. The first principal component in these SSMs, contributing more than 65% to the total explained variations, was highly related to overall head sizes. To model growth patterns, expected average heads for different ages and per-vertex growth rates were computed. Our results showed that the entire female head basically reaches its mature size at age 13–14, whereas in males it continues to increase until age 16–17. This study therefore provides valuable references for children's head/face-related product design, including the development of a more accurate sizing system and improvements in product fit and function.",

    "doi": "10.1016/j.apergo.2022.103957",
    "abstract": "This paper presents an analysis of space perception and how visual cues, such as landmarks and sound, are perceived and impact people's behaviour while exploring a given outdoor space. The primary goal of the research is to investigate how auditory sensations and visual stimuli influence people's behaviour in outdoor built environments. Our technique compares people's perception of the built environment in different conditions: the real world and a replicated virtual world. As a case study, a university campus was used, and four experimental conditions were designed. The study followed a between-subjects design, and the data collection included gaze data acquired from an eye-tracking device as well as self-reports. The study concludes that sound influences human behaviour in such settings. More specifically conclusions are that: i) human behaviour in virtual replications of the real space, including both visual and sound stimuli, is tendentially more similar to human behaviour in the real world than in simulations omitting sound; and ii) there is a difference in human behaviour when people explore the same virtually replicated outdoor space, by varying the presence of sound. This study is particularly useful for researchers working on the comparison between human behaviour in virtual and real environments, related to visual and sound stimuli.",

    "abstract": "Sense of presence is a widely assessed dimension of video game player experience. A systematic literature review and a meta-analysis were conducted to provide a more comprehensive view of the elements of game design that have an effect on the sense of presence, as well as its different dimensions studied and assessment techniques. The review revealed that many major categories of game design aspects were well represented. The meta-analysis revealed that several game design factors have significant effects on different dimensions of presence. The largest revealed effects were that playing games with a head-mounted display and motion controller rather than a monitor display and non-motion controller has a large effect on global presence. Also, playing with human co-players rather than computer-controlled co-players and playing cooperatively rather than competitively have a very large and large effect on social presence, respectively. Implications for future research are discussed, such as investigating the effects of design factors on presence in a more targeted manner, systematically assessing presence with its most relevant sub-dimensions, and using more similar rating scales. Design recommendations, with their expected impact on players’ sense of presence, are proposed.",

    "abstract": "The purpose of this study is to quantify performance in human-robot interaction under time-delay conditions in a lunar tele-operations sampling task, by testing the hypothesis that an increase of time-delay would lead to higher perceived workload and lower human performance in human-robotic integrated operations. Tele-operation is key in the exploration of the Moon, and allows for robotic elements to be controlled from orbital infrastructure and other planetary bodies such as the Earth. Considering that future missions aim to control rovers (amongst others for sampling tasks) from Earth (delay: 3s), the Gateway (delay: 0.5s) and the Moon (delay: 0s), control under the time-delay conditions for these locations must be studied. Time-delay can affect performance, and understanding the performance means that mission operations can be planned bottom-up, which benefits both the preparation of the crew and the design of rovers. An experiment was conducted with 18 engineers who were assigned to control a robotic arm under three time-delay conditions, representing the three control locations. Several metrics were derived from cardiac, ocular, subjective and behavioral measures. The analyses disclosed that the large time-delay condition statistically increased the perceived workload, the time to complete the mission and decreased heart rate variability compared to the other conditions. However, no effect of time-delay was found on attentional and executive abilities. The metrics proved to be effective in the study of performance quantification in human-robot interaction for tele-operations in lunar control scenarios. This approach can be implemented for a larger range of robotic activities, such as tele-operated driving.",

    "abstract": "Lifting tasks remain one of the leading causes of musculoskeletal disorders (MSDs), primarily in the low back region. Lifting analysis tools are, therefore, designed for assessing the risk of low back pain. Shoulder musculoskeletal problems have emerged as common MSDs associated with manual handling tasks. It is hypothesized that gripping force is related to lifting conditions and may be used as a supplementary risk metric for MSDs in the shoulder and low back regions, because it measures additional hand exertions for coupling the lifted object during lifting. We assessed the capability tactile gloves for measuring the gripping force during lifting as a means for assessing different task conditions (lifting weight, lifting height, lifting direction, body rotation, and handle). Thirty participants wore the tactile gloves and performed simulated lifting tasks. Regression models were used to analyze the effects of the task variables on estimating the measured gripping force. Results demonstrated that 58% and 70% of the lifting weight variance were explained by the measured gripping force without and with considering the individual difference, respectively. In addition to the lifting risk measures commonly used by practitioners, this study suggests a potential for using gripping force as a supplementary or additional risk metric for MSDs.",

Movement time (MT) and driving accuracy (DA) were also measured. Despite no significant differences in the primary outcome between joysticks, the I-shaped joystick with rounded tips (neutral grip) was ranked higher than the others. MT did not differ between joysticks, but DA was higher for the thin-columnar I-shaped joystick (pinch grip) than for the U- and T-shaped joysticks (pronated grip). MT and DA scores for young adults were significantly better than those for older adults. Further studies should be conducted to clarify possible factors related to EPW operability.",

    "abstract": "When designing wearables that interface with the human head, face and neck, designers and engineers consider human senses, ergonomics and comfort. A dense 3D pressure discomfort threshold map could be helpful, but does not exist yet. Differences in pressure discomfort threshold for areas of the head, neck and face were recorded, to create a 3D pressure discomfort threshold map. Between 126 and 146 landmarks were placed on the left side of the head, face and neck of twenty-eight healthy participants (gender balanced). The positions of the landmarks were specified using an EEG 10–20 system-based landmark-grid on the head and a self-developed grid on the face and neck. A 3D scan was made to capture the head geometry and landmark coordinates. In a randomised order, pressure was applied on each landmark with a force gauge until the participant indicated experiencing discomfort. By interpolating all collected pressure discomfort thresholds based on their corresponding 3D coordinates, a dense 3D pressure discomfort threshold map was made. A relatively low-pressure discomfort threshold was found in areas around the nose, neck front, mouth, chin-jaw, cheek and cheekbone, possibly due to the proximate or direct location of nerves, blood veins and soft (muscular) tissue. Medium pressure discomfort was found in the neck back, forehead and temple regions. High pressure discomfort threshold was found in the back of the head and scalp, where skin is relatively thin and closely supported by bone, making these regions interesting for mounting or resting head, face and neck related equipment upon.",

    "abstract": "To investigate the variability-fatigue and repeaters-replacers hypotheses, motor variability (MV) and indicators of fatigue were assessed during repetitive lifting. Eighteen participants performed sequential repetitive bouts of lifting divided into a short bout, and three phases of a prolonged bout until volitional fatigue (or until a 1-h time limit). Whole-body kinematics were collected to calculate variability in three-dimensional joint angles and in continuous relative phase (CRP) of sagittal joint angle couplings, which were summed for the upper and lower body, and whole-body. Excellent individual consistency (ICC = 0.95–0.97) was demonstrated across lifting bouts as fatigue developed. Therefore, strong evidence was obtained for MV as an individual trait in support of the repeaters-replacers hypothesis. Associations were found for endurance and baseline effort with lower body variability, while no associations were found for rate of fatigue. Thus, some support was found for the variability-fatigue hypothesis which suggests that repeaters are less fatigue-resistant than replacers.",

    "abstract": "This research focused on investigating the effectiveness of Transcutaneous Vagal Nerve Stimulation (tVNS) as compared to Galvanic Cutaneous Stimulation (GCS) at mitigating Simulator Adaptation Syndrome (SAS). Fifty drivers (mean age = 23.04 ± 17.71 years old, twenty-two men) participated in a driving simulation experiment. The total scores of the Simulator Sickness Questionnaire, head movements (body balance index), and driving performance variables were measured under five stimulation conditions: i) baseline (no stimulation delivered), ii) sham GCS, iii) sham tVNS, iv) active GCS, and v) active tNVS. The results showed that tVNS alleviated SAS and improved driving performance variables more effectively than GCS. We conclude that GCS and tVNS have similar neurological mechanisms to reduce SAS, providing possible explanations for the greater effectiveness of tVNS. We encourage the use of tVNS to decrease SAS.",

    "abstract": "The study aimed to determine if overnight heart rate variability (HRV) is reflective of workload and stress during military training. Measures of cognitive load, perceived exertion, physical activity, nocturnal HRV, cognitive performance and sleep were recorded for a 15-day assessment period in 32 combat engineers. The assessment period consisted of 4 phases, PRE, FIELD, BASE and RECOVERY that exposed trainees to periods of sleep deprivation and restriction. The FIELD phase was characterised by an increase in mood disturbance, perceived exertion, physical activity, HRV and a reduction in sleep quantity (p < 0.05). Measures of HRV returned to PRE-values quicker than subjective wellbeing responses. The combination of sleep duration (β = −0.002, F = 13.42, p < 0.001) and physical activity (metabolic equivalents, β = −0.483, F = 5.95, p = 0.017), the main stressors of the exercise, provided a significant effect in the best predictive model of HRV. The different recovery rates of HRV and subjective wellbeing suggest a different physiological and psychological response.",

    "abstract": "We aimed to use the bookmark method to establish minimum standards for selecting intensive care flight paramedics. Two subject matter expert (SME) focus groups reviewed nine videos of decreasing duration showing land and water helicopter rescue tasks. Focus Group 1 (FG1, n = 10) viewed videos individually off-site, whilst Focus Group 2 (FG2, n = 9) attended a face-to-face session. All SMEs selected the video they judged as the appropriate pace for the task then reviewed feedback. For both groups, the process was repeated until 80% agreement was achieved, or three rounds were completed (whichever occurred first). FG1 and FG2 achieved agreement after two rounds for the land task. For the water task, FG1 did not reach agreement. FG2 reached consensus after two rounds. The selected task durations were similar. The bookmark method is valuable to determine performance standards for performing winch rescue, and SMEs are more likely to reach consensus when face-to-face.",

    "abstract": "Static biomechanical simulations are sometimes used to estimate in vivo kinetic demands because they can be solved efficiently, but this ignores any potential inertial effects. To date, comparisons between static and dynamic analyses of spinal demands have been limited to lumbar joint differences in young males performing sagittal lifts. Here we compare static and dynamic vertebral compressive and shear force estimates during axial, lateral, and sagittal lifting tasks across all thoracic and lumbar vertebrae in older men and women. Participant-specific thoracolumbar full-body musculoskeletal models estimated vertebral forces from recorded kinematics both with and without consideration of dynamic effects, at an identified frame of peak vertebral loading. Static analyses under-predicted dynamic compressive and resultant shear forces, by an average of about 16% for all three lifts across the thoracic and lumbar spine but were highly correlated with dynamic forces (average r2 > .95). The study outcomes have the potential to enable standard clinical and occupational estimates using static analyses.",

    "abstract": "Measuring shoe-floor friction is critical for assessing the safety of footwear products. Portable devices for measuring coefficient of friction (COF) are needed. This study introduces such a device and evaluates its ability to predict human slip events across shoe designs. A portable device (18 kg) was utilized to measure 66 unique shoe-floor-fluid coefficients of friction (COF). Consistent with the shoes, flooring, and fluid contaminants from the COF tests, participants (n = 66) were unexpectedly exposed to the fluid while walking. Slip predictions were made based on a separate training data set. Slip predictions were made prospectively and using logistic regression analyses. The slip predictions were valid (p < 0.001), 91% sensitive, and 64% specific. The logistic regression fit also revealed that the COF values predicted slip outcomes (p = 0.006). This device is expected to expand the capacity of researchers, product developers, forensic engineers, and safety professionals to prevent slips and enhance human safety.",

    "abstract": "Ambulance services require candidates to pass physical employment tests (PETs) to be deemed suitable for the paramedic role. Whilst some research has been undertaken to improve to relevance of these tests, they are often arbitrary and not based on research. The first phase in developing PETs is to generate a list of job tasks. To examine the utility of universal physical tasks tests for ambulance work, we conducted a cross-sectional study, utilising the results from previous work in a Canadian ambulance service to create a physical tasks checklist. These lists were then used by paramedics working for an Australian Service to identify physical tasks in their workplace, and the results from the two services were compared. Patient transfer tasks were similar in frequency and description for both services. Stretcher handling and manoeuvring was identified by Canadian paramedics as highly strenuous, (mean rating of perceived exertion (RPE) 7/10) but were rated mean RPE <3/10 by AV paramedics. Although some tasks between these two services were similar, the ambulance services in this study differed sufficiently with regard to equipment, training and policies mean that similarly titled jobs are not comparable, cross-nationally. Service specific job task analysis is required to develop PETs that ensure employees are specifically selected to meet the requirements of that service.",

To evaluate their workload heart rate (HR), % heart rate reserve (%HRR), blood pressure (BP), metabolic equivalent (MET), and energy expenditure (EE) were measured over two workdays and two off-workdays.

Mean average and peak HR, %HRR, MET, and EE were significantly higher during a workday than an off-workday for the entire work shift, first and last hour of work. Mean average HR and %HRR saw the largest increase between the lunch and post-lunch interim. One-fourth of subjects exceeded the recommended 30% HRR threshold for 8-hour shifts. Some workers experienced a substantial increase in HR and DBP over a workday indicating physiologic fatigue and thus may be at increased risk for cardiovascular disease and premature death due to excessive physical work demands.",

    "abstract": "Future visions of transport systems include both a drive towards automated vehicles and the need for sustainable, active, modes of travel. The combination of these requirements needs careful consideration to ensure the integration of automated vehicles does not compromise vulnerable road users. Transport networks need to be resilient to automation integration, which requires foresight of possible challenges in their interaction with other road users. Focusing on a cyclist overtake scenario, the application of operator event sequence diagrams and a predictive systems failure method provide a novel way to analyse resilience. The approach offers the opportunity to review how automation can be positively integrated into road transportation to overcome the shortfalls of the current system by targeting organisational, procedural, equipment and training measures.",

    "abstract": "Personas are widely recognized as valuable design tools for communicating dimensions of individuals, yet they often lack critical contextual factors. For those people managing chronic health conditions, the home is a critical context of their patient work system (PWS). We propose the development of ‘home personas’ to convey essential aspects of the home context to those tasked with designing technologies and interventions to fit it. We used an iterative, multi-stakeholder design process to design ‘home personas’ for a model population, families caring for children with medical complexity. Each of the four resultant home personas—Multi-level, Customized, Ranch, and Rental—has a unique home layout, pain points, and are described on three dimensions that emerged from the data. This study builds on a foundation of work in the emerging field of Patient Ergonomics, describing a mechanism for distilling rich descriptions of the PWS into brief yet informative design tools.",

    "abstract": "The research on human-robot interactions indicates possible differences toward robot trust that do not exist in human-human interactions. Research on these differences has traditionally focused on performance degradations. The current study sought to explore differences in human-robot and human-human trust interactions with performance, consideration, and morality trustworthiness manipulations, which are based on ability/performance, benevolence/purpose, and integrity/process manipulations, respectively, from previous research. We used a mixed factorial hierarchical linear model design to explore the effects of trustworthiness manipulations on trustworthiness perceptions, trust intentions, and trust behaviors in a trust game. We found partner (human versus robot) differences across all three trustworthiness perceptions, indicating biases towards robots may be more expansive than previously thought. Additionally, there were marginal effects of partner differences on trust intentions. Interestingly, there were no differences between partners on trust behaviors. Results indicate human biases toward robots may be more complex than considered in the literature.",

    "abstract": "This study aims to investigate whether behavioral variability and participants’ self-ratings can be used to detect mind-wandering while driving and to examine their effects on braking performance during a driving task. We created a novel driving task and added a sustained attention response task (SART). We examined the effects of mind-wandering on braking performance and whether mind-wandering could be detected from SART response variability. The within-subjects results showed that self-reports of inattentiveness during driving correlated significantly with SART response variability. Multiple regression analysis with brake reaction time as the dependent variable revealed a significant relationship between self-reports of inattentiveness and mind-wandering. However, there were no other consistent linear associations between mind-wandering and SART response variability. Our results not only suggest that inattentiveness to driving caused by mind-wandering impairs braking performance but also emphasize the importance and difficulty of detecting this state from behavioral data alone.",

    "abstract": "A prime concern for automated vehicles is motion comfort, as an uncomfortable ride may reduce acceptance of the technology amongst the general population. However, it is not clear how transient motions typical for travelling by car affect the experience of comfort. Here, we determine the relation between properties of vehicle motions (i.e., acceleration and jerk) and discomfort empirically, and we evaluate the ability of normative models to account for the data. 23 participants were placed in a moving-base driving simulator and presented sinusoidial and triangular motion pulses with various peak accelerations (A max0.4 − 2 ms−2) and jerks (J max0.5 − 15 ms−3), designed to recreate typical vehicle accelerations. Participants provided discomfort judgments on absolute ‘Verbal Qualifiers’ and relative ‘Magnitude Estimates’ associated with these motions. The data show that discomfort increases with acceleration amplitude, and that the strength of this effect depends on the direction of motion. We furthermore find that higher jerks (shorter duration pulses) are considered more comfortable, and that triangular pulses are more comfortable than sinusoidal pulses. ME responses decrease (i.e., reduced discomfort) with increasing pulse duration. Evaluations of normative models of vibration and shock (ISO 2631), and perceived motion intensity provide mixed results. The vibration model could not account for the data well. Reasonable agreement between predictions and observations were found for the shock model and perceived intensity model, which emphasize the role of acceleration. We present novel statistical models that describe motion comfort as a function of acceleration, jerk, and direction. The present findings are essential to develop motion planning algorithms aimed at maximizing comfort.",

    "doi": "10.1016/j.apergo.2022.103882",
    "abstract": "Long-haul cabin crew regularly report misalignment between their circadian phase and the external world (i.e. jet lag). The extent to which changes in circadian phase relate to reported levels of jet lag remains unclear. The main aim of the present study was first to evaluate the relationship between objective (circadian phase) and subjective jet lag and second to explore the relative role of both subjective and objective psycho-behavioural factors in predicting the subjective experience of jet lag. Twenty-eight long-haul cabin crew completed questionnaires measuring diurnal preference, trip characteristics and subjective jet lag as a single and as a multidimensional measure. Sleep was monitored using actigraphy and urinary melatonin peak time was measured, at baseline (T1), e.g. before a long-haul trip and post-trip on the crew's first recovery day (T2). Subjective jet lag was also measured at both time points. At T1, later circadian phase related to increased unidimensional jet lag, however, a post-trip discrepancy was found between objective and subjective uni- and multidimensional jet lag measured at T2 and change from T1 to T2. After controlling for direction and size of circadian phase, increased uni- and multidimensional subjective jet lag was predicted by depressed mood states. The regression models including phase, diurnal preference, departure time on the outbound sector and arousal levels accounted for 28% of the variance in unidimensional jet lag and 53% of the variance in multidimensional jet lag. It was concluded that there is a discordance between objective and subjective jet lag post-trip. Further, subjective jet lag in long-haul cabin crew is better explained by mood impairment than circadian phase. The results are discussed with reference to the gap between subjective and objective jet lag and the role of psychology rather than just biology in the jet lag experience. The implications for improving health and safety in the workplace, through a better understanding of the role of human factors in the management of jet lag, are discussed.",

In 2018, a new standard was implemented in California aiming to prevent work-related injuries of hospitality industry workers. This paper assesses California housekeepers performing regular work tasks during their shifts from 2018 to 2020. Rapid Upper Limb Assessments (RULA) after the standard was implemented found average right-arm scores for scrubbing tasks (M = 6.93, SD = 0.00), vacuuming (M = 6.27, SD = 0.45), and trash-collecting (M = 4.48, SD = 0.50). Forces to move housekeeping carts were also evaluated, with 98% of pushing forces and 73% of turning forces observed within the accepted range. Results show that RULA scores remain high even after the implementation of the standard, with improvements only seen in tasks that required just changing of the method.",

    "abstract": "The use of robotic swarms has become increasingly common in research, industrial, and military domains for tasks such as collective exploration, coordinated movement, and collective localization. Despite the expanded use of robotic swarms, little is known about how swarms are perceived by human operators. To characterize human-swarm interactions, we evaluate how operators perceive swarm characteristics, including movement patterns, control schemes, and occlusion. In a series of experiments manipulating movement patterns and control schemes, participants tracked swarms on a computer screen until they were occluded from view, at which point participants were instructed to estimate the spatiotemporal dynamics of the occluded swarm by mouse click. In addition to capturing mouse click responses, eye tracking was used to capture participants eye movements while visually tracking swarms. We observed that manipulating control schemes had minimal impact on the perception of swarms, and that swarms are easier to track when they are visible compared to when they were occluded. Regarding swarm movements, a complex pattern of data emerged. For example, eye tracking indicates that participants more closely track a swarm in an arc pattern compared to sinusoid and linear movement patterns. When evaluating behavioral click-responses, data show that time is underestimated, and that spatial accuracy is reduced in complex patterns. Results suggest that measures of performance may capture different patterns of behavior, underscoring the need for multiple measures to accurately characterize performance. In addition, the lack of generalizable data across different movement patterns highlights the complexity involved in the perception of swarms of objects.",

    "abstract": "Load carriage (LC) is a contributing factor to musculoskeletal injury in many occupations. Given that falls are a common mechanism of injury for those frequently engaging in LC, understanding the effects of LC on postural stability (PS) is necessary. A systematic review and meta-analysis was conducted to examine effects of LC on PS. Sixteen and 9 studies were included in the qualitative and quantitative synthesis, respectively. In most studies, it was found that LC leads to a decrease in PS with significant effects on center of pressure (COP) sway area (standardized mean difference = 0.45; p < 0.005) and COP anterior-posterior excursion (standardized mean difference = 0.52; p < 0.05). Furthermore, load magnitude and load placement are factors which can significantly affect COP measures of PS. It is recommended to minimize load magnitude and equally distribute load when possible to minimize LC effects on PS. Future research should examine additional factors contributing to differences in individual PS responses to LC such as changes in muscle activation and prior LC experience.",

Results In the experimental condition, participants showed a significantly increased motion activity and a reduced muscle stiffness compared to the control condition. Furthermore, discomfort occurred significantly more frequently in the control condition. Conclusion The mobilization system increased motion activity and reduced discomfort as well as muscle stiffness. Therefore, it provides considerable potential to counteract negative effects of prolonged sitting and to promote truck driver's health.",

    "abstract": "This research examined three specific gaps in the workload transition literature: (1) the impact of workload transition rate, (2) the applicability of current theoretical explanations, and (3) the variability of performance overall and over time. Sixty Naval flight students multitasked in an unmanned aerial vehicle control testbed and workload transitioned at three rates: slow, medium, or fast. Response time and accuracy were analyzed via growth curve modeling. Slow transitions had the largest decline in performance over time. Medium transitions had some of the slowest, but most accurate and consistent performance. Fast transitions had some of the fastest, but least accurate performance. However, all performance trends significantly varied, suggesting multiple theoretical explanations may apply and performance may also depend on the individual. Design guidance on how to maximize performance goals with transition rate is provided, but future research needs to study the theoretical explanations and impact of individual differences further.",

    "abstract": "The incidence of musculoskeletal disorders (MSD) in the healthcare professional population is concerning. In particular, the high incidence of back injuries is an issue for nurses. Although many MSD prevention initiatives are being implemented, these practices are not succeeding in reducing MSDs. Why are these efforts struggling to close the gap between knowledge and practice? This article aims to report on individual and organizational factors that may influence nurses' implementation of MSD prevention practices. A survey was sent to nurses in the Quebec health and social services network. A total of 399 questionnaires were completed and analyzed. The results revealed that nurses have the required knowledge on MSD prevention practices, but have difficulty applying them in their professional context. It would appear that successful implementation of MSD prevention practices relies mainly on organizational factors, including management support, organizational culture, feedback mechanisms, and training that is adapted to the work environment.",

    "abstract": "Even though the rail industry has made great strides in reducing accidents at crossings, train-vehicle collisions at Highway-Rail Grade Crossings (HRGCs) continue to be a major issue in the US and across the world. In this research, we conducted a driving simulator study (N = 35) to evaluate a hybrid in-vehicle auditory alert (IVAA), composed of both speech and non-speech components, that was selected after two rounds of subjective evaluation studies. Participants drove through a simulated scenario and reacted to HRGCs with and without the IVAA present and through different music conditions and crossing devices. Driver simulator testing results showed that the inclusion of the hybrid IVAA significantly improved driving behavior near HRGCs in terms of gaze behavior, braking reaction, and approach speed to the crossing. The driving simulator study also showed the effects of background music and warning device types on driving performance. The study contributes to the large-scale implementation of IVAAs at HRGCs, as well as the development of guidelines toward a more standardized approach for IVAAs at HRGCs.",

    "abstract": "Simulated environments have become better able to replicate the real world and can be used for a variety of purposes, such as testing new technology without any of the costs or risks associated with working in the real world. Because of this, it is now possible to gain a better understanding of cognitive demands when working in operational environments, where individuals are often required to multitask. Multitasking often results in performance decrements, where adding more tasks can cause a decrease in performance in each of the individual tasks. However, little research investigated multitasking performance in simulated environments. In the current study we examined how multitasking affects performance in simulated environments. Forty-eight participants performed a dual visual search and word memory task where participants were navigated through a simulated environment while being presented with words. Performance was then compared to single-task performance (visual search and word memory alone). Results showed that participants experienced significant dual-task interference when comparing the dual-tasks to the single-tasks and subjective measures confirmed these findings. These results could provide useful insight for the design of technology in operational environments, but also serve as an evaluation of MRT in simulated environments.",

    "doi": "10.1016/j.apergo.2022.103877",
    "abstract": "In the past few years, companies have started considering the adoption of upper-limb occupational exoskeletons as a solution to reduce the health and cost issues associated with work-related shoulder overuse injuries. Most of the previous research studies have evaluated the efficacy of these devices in laboratories by measuring the reduction in muscle exertion resulting from device use in stereotyped tasks and controlled conditions. However, to date, uncertainties exist about generalizing laboratory results to more realistic conditions of use. The current study aims to investigate the in-field efficacy (through electromyography and perceived exertion), usability, and acceptance of a commercial spring-loaded upper-limb exoskeleton in cleaning job activities. The operators were required to maintain prolonged overhead postures while holding and moving a pole equipped with tools for window and ceiling cleaning. Compared to the normal working condition, the exoskeleton significantly reduced the total shoulder muscle activity (∼17%), the activity of the anterior deltoid (∼26%), medial deltoid (∼28%), and upper trapezius (∼24%). With the exoskeleton, the operators perceived reduced global effort (∼17%) as well as a reduced local effort in the shoulder (∼18%), arm (∼22%), upper back (∼14%), and lower back (∼16%). The beneficial effect of the exoskeleton and its suitability in cleaning settings are corroborated by the acceptance and usability scores assigned by operators, which averaged ∼5.5 out of 7 points. To the authors' knowledge, this study is the first to present an experience of exoskeleton use in cleaning contexts. The outcomes of this research invite further studies to test occupational exoskeletons in various realistic applications to foster scientific-grounded ergonomic evaluations and encourage the informed adoption of the technology.",

    "doi": "10.1016/j.apergo.2022.103879",
    "abstract": "The objective of this study was to quantify performance in an obstacle clearance task among individuals with excess body weight or body mass index (BMI). Task performance was operationalized as the maximum obstacle height cleared, four duration measures of successful task completion and compensatory movements used in the process of task completion. Eighteen participants with a BMI exceeding 30 kg/m2 completed a laboratory experiment that required stepping over seven lightweight obstacles. Obstacle heights were sequentially increased from 36 cm in 5 cm increments until participants were unsuccessful or unable to clear the obstacle up to 66 cm. Successful task completions decreased from 100% at an obstacle height of 36 cm to 66.1% at 66 cm. Higher obstacle heights were associated with significantly fewer task completions, longer leading and trailing leg stance and overall task duration, and more frequent use of compensatory movements for successful obstacle clearance. Cox PH regression was used to test the association between probability of obstacle clearance and normalized obstacle height adjusting for BMI, standing balance, and type of compensatory movement used, namely, hover and pivot motions involving the leg, and hands for bracing. The probability of successful task completion significantly decreased with increases in BMI (hazard ratio, HR = 1.14, 95% CI: 1.05–1.25), and increased with use of a leg pivot motion (HR = 0.30, 95% CI: 0.09–0.96) during task completion, after adjusting for standing balance and other types of compensatory movements. Overall, the results demonstrated that obstacle clearance performance is affected by an individual's BMI and the use of compensatory behaviors for regaining stability. The ability to recruit internal and external stabilization techniques could potentially serve as a clinical indicator of reduced fall risk and be the focus of fall prevention interventions. Implications for evaluating stability, fall risk, and identifying modifiable factors for fall prevention in the obese population are discussed.",

We aimed to determine the strength of the evidence-base regarding the effectiveness of double-checking which underpins its widespread adoption. We searched for quantitative studies of the effectiveness of two-person checking in industry sectors, excluding healthcare. We performed a systematic literature search across six databases and hand-searched key journals. We completed a narrative synthesis and quality assessment of the nine studies identified. Most studies were of fair quality. Two examined the use of two-person checks in aviation, three investigated tasks in chemical manufacturing, and four studies in psychology involved proofreading and visual search tasks. All studies found that the performance of two-people checking was not superior to that of one-person in detecting errors. Further research to compare the effectiveness of different checking processes along with factors which may support optimisation of safety checks in high-consequence industries is required.",

But little is known about appropriate durations for data collection. In this study, location observations collected from 24 office workers on a 1220 m2 office floor over a 3-month period, were analysed to determine how many days are required to estimate their typical movement and spatial behaviours. The analysis showed that up to 8 days of data was sufficient to characterise participants' typical daily movement behaviours and 10 days were required to estimate their typical spatial mobility. However, the results also indicate that 5 weeks of data collection are required to gather the necessary 10 days of data from each participant. These findings will help researchers and workplace professionals to understand the capabilities and requirements of IPS when considering their use in indoor work environments.",

    "doi": "10.1016/j.apergo.2022.103863",
    "abstract": "Measuring trust is an important element of effective human-robot collaborations (HRCs). It has largely relied on subjective responses and thus cannot be readily used for adapting robots in shared operations, particularly in shared-space manufacturing applications. Additionally, whether trust in such HRCs differ under altered operator cognitive states or with sex remains unknown. This study examined the impacts of operator cognitive fatigue, robot reliability, and operator sex on trust symptoms in collaborative robots through both objective measures (i.e., performance, heart rate variability) and subjective measures (i.e., surveys). Male and female participants were recruited to perform a metal surface polishing task in partnership with a collaborative robot (UR10), in which they underwent reliability conditions (reliable, unreliable) and cognitive fatigue conditions (fatigued, not fatigued). As compared to the reliable conditions, unreliable robot manipulations resulted in perceived trust, an increase in both sympathetic and parasympathetic activity, and operator-induced reduction in task efficiency and accuracy but not precision. Cognitive fatigue was shown to correlate with higher fatigue scores and reduced task efficiency, more severely impacting females. The results highlight key interplays between operator states of fatigue, sex, and robot reliability on both subjective and objective responses of trust. These findings provide a strong foundation for future investigations on better understanding the relationship between human factors and trust in HRC as well as aid in developing more diagnostic and deployable measures of trust.",

Extended Reality (XR) can provide an immersive, realistic user experience that, when integrated with augmented clinical tools (ACT), can improve training outcomes and provide real-time guidance during non-routine tasks, diagnostic, and therapeutic procedures. The goal of this study was to develop a framework to guide XR platform development using astronaut medical training and guidance as the domain for illustration. We conducted a mixed-methods study—using video conference meetings (45 subject-matter experts), Delphi panel surveys, and a web-based card sorting application—to develop a standard taxonomy of essential XR capabilities. We augmented this by identifying additional models and taxonomies from related fields. Together, this “taxonomy of taxonomies,” and the essential XR capabilities identified, serve as an initial framework to structure the development of XR-based medical training and guidance for use during deep space exploration missions. We provide a schematic approach, illustrated with a use case, for how this framework and materials generated through this study might be employed.",

    "abstract": "A dual task was designed to involve a tracking mission with various tracking speeds and a spatial compatibility task with various signal-key mappings and presentation modalities. This dual task was used to investigate the effects of workload and resource competition in distinct parts of the dual-task process. The results demonstrated that increasing the tracking speed adversely affected the tracking performance but led to positive arousal to the secondary discrete response task. Visual spatial signals gave the shortest reaction time due to the optimal time-sharing of the visual resources in the focal and ambient channels. Compared with visual spatial signals, spatial signals of auditory and tactile modalities did not lead to an improved performance because of their cross-modality nature. These findings provided practical design guidelines for dual tasks in which the operators need to complete a continuous monitoring task visually and elicit timely and accurate responses to spatial information.",

It also requires reflection on the working conditions and a negotiation of solutions with the stakeholders concerned. This article seeks to show that a participatory approach, built using organisational simulation, provides a framework with which to understand the reality of each profession and co-construct suitable solutions. Our action-research took place in a hospital's pneumology ward. The methodology can be broken down into four phases: diagnosis, sharing of the diagnosis, organisational simulation (the focus of this article) and experimenting with solutions. The results show that the approach gave the stakeholders the opportunity to discover and discuss the rules and constraints of actual work, to compare their different views, and to develop a new and shared view of the work situation. The approach allowed them to co-construct relevant solutions and to appropriate the changes necessary for their success.",

    "abstract": "Pressure sensitivity research on the head, face, and neck is critical to develop ways to reduce discomfort caused by pressure in head-related products. The aim of this paper is to provide information for designers to be able to reduce the pressure discomfort by studying the relation between pressure sensitivity and soft tissue in the head, face and neck. We collected pressure discomfort threshold (PDT) and pressure pain threshold (PPT) from 119 landmarks (unilateral) for 36 Chinese subjects. Moreover, soft tissue thickness data on the head, face and neck regions of 50 Chinese people was obtained through CT scanning while tissue deformation data under the PDT and PPT states was obtained from literature. The results of the three-elements correlation analysis revealed that soft tissue thickness is positively correlated with deformation but not an important factor in pressure sensitivity. Our high-precision pressure sensitivity maps confirm earlier findings of more rough pressure sensitivity studies, while also revealing additional fine scale sensitivity differences. Finally, based on the findings, a high-precision \"recommended map” of the optimal stress-bearing area of the head, face and neck was generated.",

    "abstract": "Despite the importance of being both fast and accurate in lethal force decisions, there is little empirical evidence to identify how speed impacts threat-related decisions and perception. Two experiments used speeded and unspeeded manipulations to determine how the speed imperative impacted threat assessments. Experiment 1 used drift diffusion modeling to quantify decision parameters, including rate of information processing, decision threshold, bias, and non-decisional processes. Speeded conditions reduced the information threshold needed to make decisions and shortened non-decisional processes, yet this manipulation had no impact on the rate of information processing or starting bias. Experiment 2 explored perceptual differences in threat assessment. Participants confidently made threat assessments despite only 30 ms exposure to stimuli with little impact on their subjective threat ratings based on exposure duration. Taken together, these results document the influence of speed on decision-making parameters of threat assessments while demonstrating little impact on threat perception.",

The ability to classify the female body shape is highly desired by the clothing industry and apparel researchers for improving pattern design and fit. In order to objectively classify female torso shapes, we employed principal component analysis on torso related anthropometric measurements and three-dimensional (3D) torso surface data to identify the most dominant measurements. The principal component analysis of the anthropometric measurements show that Waist Circumference is the most dominant variable to define overall female torso size, and that Chest-Waist Drop and Waist-Buttock Drop jointly define the local shape of the torso. Using these findings, a torso shape classification scheme was developed, where nine shape categories were defined from Chest-Waist Drop and Waist-Buttock Drop while torso sizes were divided by Waist Circumference. The distribution of nine shape categories is dependent on the value of Waist Circumference. Mean shape of each shape category was then generated from 3D scans.",

    "abstract": "Increasing levels of vehicle automation are envisioned to allow drivers to engage in other activities but are also likely to increase the incidence of Carsickness or Motion Sickness (MS). Ideally, MS is studied in a safe and controlled environment, such as a driving simulator. However, only few studies address the suitability of driving simulators to assess MS. In this study, we validate a moving base driving simulator for MS research by comparing the symptoms and time course of MS between a real-road driving scenario and a rendition of this scenario in a driving simulator, using a within-subjects design. 25 participants took part as passengers in an experiment with alternating sections (slaloming, stop-and-go) with normal and provocative driving styles. Participants performed Sudoku puzzles (eyes-off-road) during both scenarios and reported MIsery SCale (MISC) scores at 30 s intervals. Motion Sickness Assessment Questionnaire (MSAQ) scores were collected upon completion of either scenario. Overall, the results indicate that MS was more severe in the car than in the simulator. Nevertheless, significant correlations were found between individual MS in the car and simulator for 3 out of 4 MSAQ symptom categories (0.48 < r < 0.73, p < 0.02), with a strong overall correlation (r = 0.57, p = 0.004). MS onset times were similar between the car and the simulator, and sickness fluctuations as a result of driving style showed a similar pattern between scenarios, albeit more pronounced in the car. Based on observed similarities in MS, we conclude these simulator results to have relative validity. We attribute the observed reduction of MS severity in the simulator to the downscaling of the motion by the Motion Cueing Algorithm (MCA). These results suggest that, at least in eyes-off-road conditions, findings on MS from simulator studies may generalize to real vehicles after application of a conversion factor. This conversion factor is likely to depend on simulator and MCA characteristics.",

    "abstract": "Background Despite the potential of occupational passive shoulder exoskeletons (PSEs) to relieve overhead work, limited insights in overhead work precision performance impedes large-scale adoption in industry. Objective To investigate the effect of PSE support on the reduction in task performance caused by physical fatigue. Methods This experiment consisted of a randomized, counterbalanced cross-over design comparing Exo4Work PSE support and no support, in a physically fatigued state and a control condition. Precision performance was determined using execution speed and drilling errors. Muscle activity and shoulder joint kinematics were recorded. Results Fatigue altered task performance, shoulder joint kinematics, muscle activity and subjective experience during overhead work. The PSE support mitigated the fatigue-induced changes in shoulder kinematics. Additionally, a part of the fatigue-induced co-activation of shoulder stabilizing muscles was avoided when working with the PSE. The PSE support also reduced the activity of the anterior and medial deltoid. Conclusion Physical fatigue provokes compensatory movements and increased co-contraction of muscles when executing overhead work. These fatigue-induced alterations are generally believed to increase the overall musculoskeletal load. The support provided by the PSE reduced muscle activity of muscles working to elevate the arm, but also partially mitigated those fatigue-induced effects. Significance This study shows that the effect of PSE support on precision performance is limited, and suggested that, apart from the known effects of PSE support during overhead work, wearing the exoskeleton in a physically fatigued state may provide additional advantages.",

However, we know little about the actual collaboration that occurs in the design process for a team-based care solution. This study examines how multiple perspectives were managed in the design of a team health IT solution aimed at supporting clinician information needs during pediatric trauma care transitions. We focused our analysis on four co-design sessions that involved multiple clinicians caring for pediatric trauma patients. We analyzed design session transcripts using content analysis and process coding guided by Détienne's (2006) co-design framework. We expanded upon Détienne (2006) three collaborative activities to identify specific themes and processes of collaboration between care team members engaged in the design process. The themes and processes describe how team members collaborated in a team health IT design process that resulted in a highly usable technology.",

    "abstract": "As driving performance relies heavily on the interpretation of visual information, driving simulators require a visual display that can effectively communicate the virtual environment to the driver. Most high-fidelity visual displays include an expensive system of high-definition projectors and wraparound screens. To reduce the overall cost of a driving simulator while preserving the generalizability of results to naturalistic driving, head mounted displays (HMD) are being considered as a substitute visual cueing system. Recent innovations to virtual reality technologies are encouraging, however, differences between HMDs and more traditional visual displays have not been explored for all types of driving measures. In particular, while existing literature provides insight into the validity of HMDs as a substitute for higher fidelity visual displays in tests of driver behaviour and performance, there is a gap in the literature regarding differences in physiological responses. In the current study, upper body muscle activation and joint angle ranges were compared between an Oculus™ Rift Development Kit 2 HMD and a system of wrap around screens. Twenty-one participants each completed two simulated drives, one per display, in a counterbalanced order. During the simulation, drivers encountered unanticipated pedestrian crossings during which peak surface electromyography, root-mean-square of the surface electromyography signal and joint angles were determined bilaterally on the upper limbs. No significant differences (p ≤ 0.05) were observed between the Oculus™ Rift HMD and the wrap around screens for all dependent variables with the exception of left joint range of motion in female participants, suggesting that the HMD reduced field of view had a minimal effect on driver kinematics and no effect on muscle activation levels. Upper body bracing was observed during the hazard response time segments characterized by significantly increased muscle activity during hazard response time segments and minimal joint movement. Considering the lack of significant kinematic and muscle activation differences between the two visual inputs, HMD technology for hazard response may provide a suitable alternative to wrap around screens for studying kinematic responses during hazardous driving scenarios.",

    "abstract": "We recently developed a dynamic mimicking system that mounts a user's wheelchair onto a carrier platform capable of performing required manoeuvres using the wheelchair's own controls. Two wheelchair user studies were performed to evaluate users' perception of their own wheelchair and the proposed system. The first user study included ten wheelchair users who were interviewed in order to map their current perceptions toward their wheelchair and their views about its shortcomings when traversing rough terrains. In the second study, the system was explained to 33 participants who were then exposed to three simulations of its main features. Participants were interviewed and the experimenter wrote down their answers, which were analysed using IBM SPSS Statistics 27 software. The conclusions are that special consideration should be given to motorized wheelchair users, and that the designers of the system should include a user interface that explains and demonstrates the system to users.",

    "abstract": "Very few studies have examined differences between experts' and novices' foot positioning and movements during manual materials handling tasks. The impact of footstep patterns on low back loading needs to be better understood. The goals of this study were to characterize foot placement and movements in novices and experts and to assess their impact on back loading considering the height of grasp. The task consisted in transferring 24 15 kg boxes from a pallet to another. Foot placement and movements were classified with a recently developed taxonomy. Results show that experts' feet remained static more often than novices' feet during the lifting phase. Positioning the feet towards the deposit site during lifting increased asymmetrical moments, especially for novices. Positioning one foot forward increased asymmetrical moments for novices. Overall, footstep strategies are an effective indicator of low back exposure and should be considered in ergonomic studies.",

The aims of this study were (i) determine the effect of sex on essential and desirable thoracoabdominal organ boundaries, and (ii) compare essential thoracoabdominal organ boundaries with small and large hard ballistic plate sizes from the National Institute of Justice (NIJ) and determine if coverage requirements differ between sexes. 33 males and 33 females underwent supine magnetic resonance imaging of their thoracoabdominal organs. Male participants on average displayed more laterally and inferiorly positioned essential and desirable organ boundaries than females. Based on NIJ plate sizes, insufficient coverage of essential organs was identified for male and female participants. A greater range of body armour sizes and designs that better cater to the diverse anatomy of soldier populations is warranted, but must be considered in the context of ergonomic and performance implications.",

    "abstract": "This paper focuses on how the autonomy level of an assistive robot that offers support for older adults in a daily task and its feedback affect the interaction. Identifying the level of automation (LOA) that prioritizes older adults’ preferences while avoiding passiveness and sedentariness is challenging. The feedback mode should match the cognitive and perceptual capabilities of older adults and the LOA. We characterized three LOAs and paired them with two modes of feedback in a human-robot collaborative task. Twenty-seven older adults participated in evaluating the LOA-feedback variations in a mixed experimental design, utilizing an experimental setup of an assistive robot in a table clearing task. The quality of the interaction was evaluated with objective and subjective measures. The combination of high LOA with voice feedback improved the overall interaction when compared to other LOA and feedback combinations. This study emphasizes the importance of appropriate coupling of LOA and feedback for successful interaction of the older adults with an assistive robot.",

    "abstract": "This study sets out to extend the use of blink rate and pupil size to the assessment of cognitive load of completing common automotive manufacturing tasks. Nonoptimal cognitive load is detrimental to safety. Existing occupational ergonomics approaches come short of measuring dynamic changes in cognitive load during complex assembling tasks. Cognitive demand was manipulated by having participants complete two versions of the n-back task (easy, hard). Two durations of the physical task were also considered (short, long). Pupil size and blink rate increased under greater cognitive task demand. High cognitive load also resulted in longer task completion times, and higher ratings of mental and temporal demand, and effort. This exploratory study offers relevant insights on the use of ocular metrics for cognitive load assessment in occupational ergonomics. While the existing eye-tracking technology may yet limit their adoption in the field, they offer advantages over the more popular expert-based and self-reported techniques in measuring changes in cognitive load during dynamic tasks.",

    "abstract": "Visual inspections performed in the final stage of the vehicle manufacturing process are crucial for assuring the quality of painted vehicle bodies. However, lengthy visual inspections can cause fatigue and discomfort of the eyes, which may adversely affect inspection accuracy and efficiency. This study developed a new human-friendly visual inspection method for the detection of defects (e.g., scar and dent) on vehicle bodies, and compared its performance to a conventional inspection method in terms of critical fusion frequency (Hz, indirect measure of eye fatigue), defect detectability (%), and subjective satisfaction score (7-point Likert scale). The new method was devised to project bright-dark linear stripes onto the surface of the vehicle body and created emergent features (distorted stripes) where a defect existed. The critical fusion frequency of the new method decreased slightly (3.7%) after a 30-minute visual inspection task, whereas that of the conventional method dropped substantially (11.0%), which implied more severe eye fatigue. Additionally, the new method had significantly higher defect detectability (92.1%) and satisfaction score (5.8 points) than those (73.4% and 3.5 points) of the conventional method.",

    "abstract": "This study was designed to examine the roles of cue utilization, phishing features and time pressure in the detection of phishing emails. During two experiments, participants completed an email sorting task containing both phishing and genuine emails. Participants were allocated to either a high or low time pressure condition. Performance was assessed via detection sensitivity and response bias. Participants were classified with either higher or lower cue utilization and completed a measure of phishing knowledge. When participants were blind to the nature of the study (N = 191), participants with higher cue utilization were better able to discriminate phishing from genuine emails. However, they also recorded a stronger bias towards classifying emails as phishing, compared to participants with lower cue utilization. When notified of phishing base rates prior to the email sorting task (N = 191), participants with higher cue utilization were better able to discriminate phishing from genuine emails without recording an increase in rate of false alarms, compared to participants with lower cue utilization. Sensitivity increased with a reduction in time pressure, while response bias was influenced by the number of phishing-related features in each email. The outcomes support the proposition that cue-based processing of critical features is associated with an increase in the capacity of individuals to discriminate phishing from genuine emails, above and beyond phishing-related knowledge. From an applied perspective, these outcomes suggest that cue-based training may be beneficial for improving detection of phishing emails.",

This driving-simulator study examined how different types of DAS failures affected drivers' trust. The automation-failure type (no-failure, takeover-request, system-malfunction) was manipulated among 122 participants, when a critical hazard event occurred. The dependent measures included participants’ trust ratings after each of seven drives and their takeover performance following the hazard. Results showed that trust improved before any automation failure occurred, demonstrating proper trust calibration toward the errorless system. In the takeover-request and system-malfunction conditions, trust decreased similarly in response to the automation failures, although the takeover-request condition had better takeover performance. For the drives after the automation failure, trust was gradually repaired but did not recover to the original level. This study demonstrated how trust develops and responds to DAS failures, informing future research for trust repair interventions in designing DASs.",

    "abstract": "Night foggy road conditions limit visibility distance of drivers and are associated with higher accident and fatality rates than other weather conditions. Therefore, ensuring road visibility in night foggy road is critical. However, it is difficult to reproduce fog on a real road and only a few studies have researched foggy road conditions and visibility in a laboratory as a small scale. Previous studies have suggested that a color temperature of road lighting is related to visibility. However, many have only investigated the effects of relative transmittance in limited indoor experiments, and the impacts of differences in transmittance on visibility have thus far not been studied in real-scale conditions. In this study, a real-scale test involving 91 subjects was conducted to investigate how the visibility distance under night foggy conditions is affected by different lighting color temperatures. Based on the real scale experiments, the correlation between the visibility distance and lighting color temperature was derived. Road lighting with a low color temperature (i.e., yellow) was found to provide longer visibility distances than that with high color temperatures under night foggy conditions having measured visibility of approximately 102m. The impact of the differences in lighting color increased as the visibility distance decreased. In contrast, road lighting with a high color temperature (i.e., white) improved driver visibility in higher-visibility conditions. Therefore, this study confirmed the correlation between lighting color temperature and visibility distance for different visibility conditions and could serve as a foundation for the development of roadway design standards as well as future studies.",

    "abstract": "Voice assistants (VA) are virtual agents used to aid information seeking. Cues contained in speech, such as perceived gender and vocal pitch, may influence attitudes towards, and interactions with these agents. Given expansion of telehealth efforts and the potential for VA to advise patients on health-related topics outside of formal healthcare settings, the influence of VA vocal characteristics is examined in the context of medication instructions. Participants rated trust and reliance on VA after viewing medication labels and hearing recommendations from male and female agents with varying pitch. Results suggest agents perceived as female were rated as more trustworthy, while vocal pitch did not significantly influence trust. However, a trend of lower reliance with increasing pitch was observed. Additionally, participants relied significantly more on VA advice than medication labels when making decisions. Post-hoc analyses revealed trust and reliance primarily varied between participants. Pitch and gender explained only a small portion of within-participant variance. We found suggestive evidence for social categorizations distilled from vocal cues influencing interactions with agents delivering health-critical information. Future work should explore additional samples, vocal cues, and participant-level sources of variation.",

    "abstract": "Worker guidance systems provide product-specific and digital assembly information and can make an important contribution to increasing productivity and quality and relieving employees, especially in flexible variant assembly. However, a critical factor here is the successful design of the systems. While much of the research focuses on aspects of the hardware, this article is dedicated to the question of how the configuration of the level of information, i.e. the amount and depth of information in worker guidance systems, is affected. For this purpose, two studies, a laboratory study at the Technical University of Darmstadt (N = 53) and a field study at a company (N = 30), were conducted and two variants of the information level of a worker guidance system were compared. The study results show that assembly quality in particular is significantly influenced by the level of information; to the advantage of detailed information. No significant differences were found for production times. For the subjective evaluation of the system as well as for the objective and subjectively perceived strain, it can be stated that the high level of information also performs better. The results thus help to design worker guidance systems more precisely so that they fulfill the information needs of the employees as well as possible.",

    "abstract": "Introduction Playing a musical instrument can potentially lead to musculoskeletal disorders. Postural loads are different considering the instrument they play; for example violin and flute require elevation from both upper limbs, asymmetrical postures are common and instrument weight can be significant. The aim was to explore how musicians’ postures are investigated, and potentially if there is evidence of an association between postural impairments and pain. Methods A systematic search was performed in several databases, combined with manual search. Study inclusion, data extraction and quality assessment were performed independently by two reviewers. Results Twenty seven relevant studies were included in this review covering musicians with the full range of playing experience (professionals, students, teachers, amateurs). The main considered methods to investigate postures are visual assessment and three dimensional analysis using videography. Discussion This review provides a synthesis of the different methods used to monitor posture in musicians and provides information in order to build protocols which will allow comparison with previous work.",

    "abstract": "Despite the negative impact of social isolation on wellbeing, research has yet to address how organisations may mitigate the effects of workplace isolation and loneliness. The main objective of the study is to explore the mediating role of task interdependence and supportive behaviours of colleagues on the relationship between workplace isolation on workplace wellbeing. A total of 137 volunteers completed a survey assessing workplace isolation, loneliness, task interdependence, supportive behaviours of colleagues and wellbeing at work. SEM analyses supported the negative effects of company isolation on workplace wellbeing. While supportive behaviours had a mediating role, task interdependence did not mediate the relationships between company isolation and loneliness, and wellbeing. The findings show that increased opportunities for interpersonal interactions at work through greater task interdependence are not enough to reverse the negative effects of workplace isolation on wellbeing. In contrast, an investment in a supportive environment may reverse the negative effects of workplace isolation on wellbeing, highlighting the importance of a supportive culture.",
