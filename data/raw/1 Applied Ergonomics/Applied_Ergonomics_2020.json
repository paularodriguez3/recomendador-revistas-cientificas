    "abstract": "The aim of this study was to compare simulator sickness symptoms while participants wore either a virtual reality (VR) or augmented reality (AR) headset. A secondary aim involved comparing how physical motion affects symptoms. During a simulation, participants wore VR and AR headsets while standing on a motion platform and firing at hostile ships under three motion conditions: No Physical Motion; Synchronous Motion, in which the physical and displayed motion were coupled; and Asynchronous Motion, in which the physical motion did not match the display. Symptoms increased over time but were not different with respect to headset or motion. The VR condition had higher accuracy and faster response time to the commence fire instruction. Further research is necessary to determine if this holds under more extreme motion. The use of VR or AR headsets for training under gentle motion conditions is practicable and should be permissible under normal conditions during deployment.",

    "abstract": "Back-support exoskeletons (BSEs) are wearable systems designed to reduce physical demands on the back, but which could have undesired effects beyond this design intention. Participants (n = 18) used two commercial BSEs to complete a brief (~15–20 s) simulated manual assembly task in varying conditions, with outcome measures that included: working posture, activity levels in “secondary” muscle groups (shoulders and thighs), perceived balance, discomfort, and usability. Using a BSE led to small and inconsistent changes in working postures (e.g., < ~14° change in lumbar flexion), muscular activity in the secondary muscle groups (<±2% of maximum voluntary isometric contractions), or perceived balance. Limitations in movement were reported for both BSEs, however, along with moderate levels of discomfort. Task-specific responses were evident for all outcome measures, though these depended on the specific BSE used and differed between genders in many cases. Future work should focus on interactions between a given user, BSE design, and task conditions.",

We describe the development and initial usability testing of a sign to indicate that an earthquake has occurred. We involved 264 Italian adults, who completed an online survey to evaluate the evocativeness, simplicity, and universality of 16 emojis depicting earthquakes. Through a Self-Organising Map analysis we identified four similar response profiles to the evocativeness scale, differing in their mean strength. A non-metric Multidimensional Scaling suggested that evocativeness was higher for the emojis featuring a damaged building. Linear Mixed Models indicated that emojis with fabricated vs. natural structures were judged as more evocative, simpler, and more universal when characterized by danger from falling objects. In some cases, adding behavioral elements increased evocativeness. Practical implications for informing the development of a new emoji for earthquakes are discussed.",

Fourteen participants performed two tasks consisting of a lane keeping and a double lane shift with two tractors equipped with 1) a conventional and 2) an enhanced steering system. Physiological measurements, i.e., electromyography, electrodermal activity and heart rate were recorded during the tasks. Furthermore, performance measurements and subjective perception of MW were collected. Present study demonstrated that participants perceived the enhanced steering system requiring less mental demands to operate. Participants improved their performance during the lane keeping task and tended to improve in the double lane shift task with the enhanced system. Physiological measurements did not reveal differences between the steering systems. This study highlighted the dissociation of subjective indices of mental workload from physiological indices in driving of heavy vehicles.",

    "abstract": "Design and development of contemporary military body armour has traditionally focused primarily on male soldiers. As the anthropometric body dimensions of male and female soldiers differ, we aimed to determine whether current body armour was meeting fit and functional requirements of female soldiers. One-hundred and forty-seven female Australian Defence Force soldiers completed a 59-item questionnaire regarding the fit and function of current body armour. Most (68%) participants reported wearing ill-fitting body armour, which was associated with increased total musculoskeletal pain and discomfort, as well as pain at the shoulders, abdomen, and hips. Body armour that was too large was more likely to interfere with task performance when it was integrated with a combat belt, as well as when female soldiers performed operationally representative tasks. Modifying body armour design and sizing to cater to the anthropometric dimensions of female soldiers is recommended.",

Existing ergonomic assessment methods are primarily laboratory-based and, thus, inappropriate for use in the field. This study presents an approach to characterize the repetitive motions of the upper arms based on direct measurement using accelerometers. Repetition rates were derived from upper arm inclination data and with video recordings in the field. This method was used to investigate whether harvesting with mobile platforms (teams harvesting apples from the platform and the ground) increased the farmworkers’ exposure to upper arm repetitive motions compared to traditional harvesting using ladders. The ladder workers had higher repetitive motions (13.7 cycles per minute) compared to the platform and ground workers (11.7 and 12.2 cycles per minutes). The higher repetitions in the ladder workers were likely due to their ability to work independently and the additional arm movements associated with ladder climbing and walking.",

Methods A total of 19 truck drivers participated in the data collection, which included a combination of self-reports, field observations and direct measurements to report on the work shift task composition, postures, physical workload, and force exertions. Results Driving (mean of 43% of daily work shift) and delivering gas cylinders to customers (28%) were the main tasks of the truck drivers. Delivering gas cylinders measured as moderate level work and daily work duration was not excessive with respect to mean cardiac strain for most drivers. However, manual handling and force exertion activities were frequent and deemed unsafe most of the time with respect to existing guidelines on manual materials handling. Conclusion This study documents physical risk factors that are consistent with musculoskeletal pain prevalence reported for short-distance truck drivers.",

    "abstract": "Objective Currently, low back disorder (LBD) research focuses primarily on mechanical variables to assess whether task demands exceed tissue capacity; however, it is important to assess how other nonmechanical variables affect tissue capacity in a time-dependent manner. The current investigation sought to explore physiological responses to an acute lifting task, as lifting has been implicated as a risk factor in the development of LBDs. Methods Twelve participants completed two sessions of 2 h of repetitive symmetrical lifting from floor to knuckle height under two conditions, matched for total external work (Low Force High Repetition (LFHR) and High Force Low Repetition (HFLR)). Full-body kinematics and ground reaction forces were measured throughout. Interleukin 6 (IL-6) and interleukin 8 (IL-8), markers of systemic inflammation, were assessed from blood sampling at Baseline, 0, 4 and 24 h post-lifting on both days. Dual x-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) scans were also performed on participants to quantify body composition. Results Significant load (HFLR and LFHR) * time (Baseline, 0, 4, 24 h) interaction effects were found for both IL-6 and IL-8, where the LFHR condition resulted in greater responses at 0 and 4 h post-lifting. Conclusions This was the first study of its kind to concurrently measure peak and cumulative spinal moments and their relationship to systemic inflammation in both sexes, while strictly controlling for confounding variables (e.g. physical activity, caloric intake, body composition, etc.). Greater levels of IL-6 and IL-8 were seen in the LFHR condition, likely due to the greater cumulative spinal moments in this condition.",

    "doi": "10.1016/j.apergo.2020.103228",
    "abstract": "Background Despite the breadth and diversity of research and policies on care transitions, research studies often report similar components that affect the quality and safety of care, including communication across professional groups and care settings, transfer of information, coordination of resources or training of healthcare personnel. In this article, we aim to deepen our understanding of care transitions by proposing a heuristic research framework that takes into account the components and factors influencing the quality and safety of care transitions in diverse settings. Methodology Using a pragmatic qualitative narrative meta-synthesis of empirically grounded research studies (N = 13) involving 31 researchers from seven countries (Australia, Canada, Denmark, Germany, the Netherlands, Norway and the UK), we conducted a thematic analysis to identify the components analysed in the included studies. We then used these components to create a framework for researching care transitions. Results Our narrative synthesis found that the quality and safety of care transitions are influenced by a range of patient-centred, communicative, collaborative, cultural, competency-based, accountability-based and spatial components. These components are encompassed within a broader set of dimensions that require careful consideration: (1) the conceptualising of the care transition notion, (2) the methodology for researching care transitions, (3) the role of patients and carers in care transitions, (4) the complexity surrounding care transitions, (5) the boundaries intertwined in care transitions and (6) care transition improvement interventions. These six dimensions constitute an analytical framework for planning and conducting research on care transitions in diverse settings. Conclusion The proposed six-dimensional framework for researching quality and safety in care transitions offers a roadmap for future practice and policy interventions and provides a starting point for planning and designing future research.",

During the identification of the causal factors (causal scenarios) for the unsafe control actions of the human controllers, the three-phase approach proposed by France (2017) as well as the interaction problems between the subsystems in the hierarchical safety control structure were considered, and the implementation of the basic safety design procedure was included in the methodology for the improvement of system.

    "abstract": "Gibson and Crooks (1938) argued that a ‘field of safe travel’ could qualitatively explain drivers' steering behavior on straights, curved roads, and while avoiding obstacles. This study aims to quantitatively explain driver behavior while avoiding obstacles on a straight road, and quantify the ‘Driver's Risk Field’ (DRF). In a fixed-based driving simulator, 77 (7 longitudinal and 11 lateral) positions of the obstacles were used to quantify the subjectively perceived and objectively (maximum absolute steering angle) measured DRF for eight participants. The subjective response was a numerical answer to the question “How much steering do you think you need at this moment in time?” The results show that the propagation of the width of the DRF, along the longitudinal distance, resembled an hourglass shape, and all participants responded to obstacles that were placed beyond the width of the car. This implies that the Driver's Risk Field is wider than the car width.",

    "abstract": "Many sensor fusion algorithms for analyzing human motion information collected with inertial measurement units have been reported in the scientific literature. Selecting which algorithm to use can be a challenge for ergonomists that may be unfamiliar with the strengths and limitations of the various options. In this paper, we describe fundamental differences among several algorithms, including differences in sensor fusion approach (e.g., complementary filter vs. Kalman Filter) and gyroscope error modeling (i.e., inclusion or exclusion of gyroscope bias). We then compare different sensor fusion algorithms considering the fundamentals discussed using laboratory-based measurements of upper arm elevation collected under three motion speeds. Results indicate peak displacement errors of <4.5° with a computationally efficient, non-proprietary complementary filter that did not account for gyroscope bias during each of the one-minute trials. Controlling for gyroscope bias reduced peak displacement errors to <3.0°. The complementary filters were comparable (<1° peak displacement difference) to the more complex Kalman filters.",

This study aimed to (1) understand the entities and control and feedback mechanisms that influence identity crime prevention and occurrence on the darknet in the Australian system and to (2) comprehensively identify the implications of control failures across all system levels. The Systems-Theoretic Accident Model and Processes (STAMP) was used to develop an identity crime control structure in consultation with subject matter experts and then the Systems-Theoretic Process Analysis (STPA) was applied. The STPA identified 310 risk states, resulting from control failures and which were associated with the range of agencies, organisations, and individuals present across system levels. As darknet marketplaces rapidly evolve, alignment between these entities is necessary to enable agile system responses. STAMP and STPA have promise in understanding the potential for intervention across all system levels in preventing societal issues such as identity crime.",

    "title": "Defining the meaning of “sustainable work” from activity-centered ergonomics and psychodynamics of Work's perspectives",
    "journal": "Applied Ergonomics",
    "year": "2020",
    "doi": "10.1016/j.apergo.2020.103209",
    "abstract": "Introduction Work-related issues are already part of the theoretical framework and the historical rationale that underpin corporate sustainability. However, the relationship between work and sustainability is still little known in company practices. Based on the concepts of activity-centered ergonomics (ACE) and psychodynamics of work (PDW), this paper investigates the meaning of “sustainable work” in Brazilian companies. Thus, two research questions guided this study: How the concept of “sustainable work” can be defined in the perception of companies based on the perspective of ACE and PDW? How the concepts provided by these approaches can help companies in developing practices towards sustainable work? Method Case studies conducted in ten Brazilian companies engaged in corporate sustainability practices involving document analysis, interviews, and content analysis. Results Companies recognize the importance of human action in organizational processes, by considering people as the cornerstone for ensuring corporate sustainability, and seeking to build a work with meaning and significance. However, i) Improvement actions are usually mitigatory or compensatory, acting on the effects while the root causes remain untouched; ii) Sustainability initiatives focus on individual issues, in most cases on the leader (individual), narrowing its scope and neglecting broader, important topics such as work organization and work content; iii) Both work overload and work for sustainability agenda are usually disregarded; iv) A comprehensive view of health should not be limited to the workplace. Conclusions According to companies' perceptions, sustainable work includes but is not limited to integrating work to corporate sustainability guidelines, respecting labor laws and human rights, developing synergy between areas/departments towards sustainability, providing possibilities for constructing health in its multidimensionality with the worker as protagonist, and creating work that is meaningful, pleasurable and leads to happiness and recognition. ACE and PDW offer valuable concepts to support companies in bridging the gap between their corporate sustainability vision and practices, i.e., transforming guidelines into actions towards sustainable work. In this sense, sustainable work is believed to be that which improves the organization's performance and promotes professional development as well as workers' health broadly and positively (not limited to the absence of illness, but in the sense of building health) and well-being. Thus, it fosters respect for and the development of intelligence and creativity (as opposed to alienating work) by performing work that has meaning and significance, understanding the profound importance of physical, cognitive and organizational issues, and above all, the importance of work to the development of culture (Bolis et al., 2014).",

    "abstract": "This research aimed to develop a comprehensive evaluation of the mobile user interface abilities of the elderly so that technology can be designed to meet individualized needs. A total of 135 older adults were evaluated with the developed system, the Elderly Mobile User Interface Ability Evaluation System (EMUIAES). The prediction of age and the use of technology on elderly mobile interface usage were investigated based on the findings of the evaluation. The relationship between performance on Fitts' task and elderly mobile user interface ability (EMUIA) was also examined. The findings showed a strong effect of age on the elderly's use of mobile user interfaces. Previous experience with personal and tablet computers also contributed to the use of mobile user interfaces. In addition, this research demonstrated the application of Fitts' law to describe the elderly mobile user interface behaviors, particularly for tasks involving fast tapping and pointing. The EMUIAES can provide future researchers and designers a comprehensive tool to describe the elderly's diverse behaviors and changes in their ability to use mobile interfaces. Individualized interface designs for elderly users can be developed based on these findings to improve the elderly users' experiences of using technology.",

    "abstract": "Management of travelers' cognitive load is crucial for efficient information processing for optimal railway operations. We investigated variations in travelers' cognitive load with different expertise levels, in a field study. We aimed to assess the use of three eye metrics: pupil diameter, saccade amplitude and gaze of fixation duration for cognitive load analysis between expert and novice travelers in a Mass Transit train station: Saint-Michel Notre Dame. Physiological measures of emotional activity through skin conductance responses were also investigated, together with subjective measures of mental load using NASA-Task Load Index. Our results followed our expectations, where novice travelers expressed higher cognitive load than expert travelers, characterized by wider pupil diameter, larger amplitude of saccade and longer gaze duration, as well as higher electrodermal activity and NASA-TLX. Additional observations showed that experts used hierarchical and symmetrical scan paths, with more intense exposure on relevant information, characterized by brighter heat maps. This difference in behavior showed a clear difference in strategies for information retrieval at different expertise levels. Metrics of eye tracking device, together with electrodermal activity, proved to be potent in cognitive load analysis of train travelers, and helped to provide insights for real-life information processing.",

Twelve students (six males and six females) participated. The participants performed driving tasks with a driving simulator (DS) and the N-back task that was used to control their MWL. The N-back task had five difficulty levels from “none” to “3-back.” Eye and head movements were measured during the DS driving. Results showed that the standard deviation (SD) of the gaze angle, SD of eyeball rotation angle, share rate of head movement, and blink frequency had significant correlations with the task difficulty. The decision boundary of OCSVM could detect 95% of high MWL state (i.e., “3-back” state). In addition, the absolute value of the distance from the decision boundary increased with the task difficulty from “0-back” to “3-back.”",

This study aimed to evaluate the short term effect of real-time vibrotactile feedback on postural exposure using a smart workwear system for work postures intervention in simulated industrial order picking. Fifteen workers at an industrial manufacturing plant performed order-picking tasks, in which the vibrotactile feedback was used for postural training at work. The system recorded the trunk and upper arm postures. Questionnaires and semi-structured interviews were conducted about the users’ experience of the system. The results showed reduced time in trunk inclination ≥20°, ≥30° and ≥45° and dominant upper arm elevation ≥30° and ≥45° when the workers received feedback, and for trunk inclination ≥20°, ≥30° and ≥45° and dominant upper arm elevation ≥30°, after feedback withdrawal. The workers perceived the system as useable, comfortable, and supportive for learning. The system has the potential of contributing to improved postures in order picking through an automated short-term training program.",

    "abstract": "Consultations entail transitions in care between referrers and consultants, as patients visit different clinicians and care sites. This complex process has been consistently prone to communication breakdowns. Despite expectations and benefits of electronic health records (EHRs), incomplete, vague, or inappropriate referrals continue to hinder consultations; referrals can be sent to the wrong specialty service; and consultation findings frequently fail to reach referrers. Due to the inadequate support of interpersonal communication afforded by EHRs, these issues persist. Important aspects of ergonomics and human factors engineering frequently appear overlooked during the design and implementation of EHRs. Usability issues have contributed to delays in medical diagnosis, treatment, and follow-up. Some of these delays contribute to patient harms. Our multidisciplinary team of clinicians and ergonomics professionals reflects on referral and consultation. We describe how computerization in healthcare should benefit from approaches informed and developed through applied ergonomics and human factors.",

The aim of this study is to take a closer look at how MMHT are evaluated in order to identify what could explain judgement about their (lack of) effectiveness. Seventy-seven studies were included in a scoping review, and were analyzed using an inductive grid comprising numerous criteria. Workplace training programs, being the most frequent, were described in these papers in greater detail. Given the broad range of contexts it was found that MMHT differed greatly from one study to the other. All the while, contents presented through these programs were surprisingly uniform, with an emphasis on adopting the safe handling technique commonly known as “straight back, bent knees”, although such training approach principally focuses on the trainee's behaviours, while paying little (to no) attention to the work conditions that might condition correct behavioral display. Limitations of current MMHT are discussed and explanations are given in order to better explain why they are reported to be so ineffective. Concrete recommendations on how to improve them close the paper.",

    "abstract": "Environmental and logistical difficulties associated with obtaining whole-body vibration measurements from mobile equipment during operation in underground coal mines have hampered attempts to assess the potential vibration exposures associated with the use of such equipment. An alternative measurement technique was used to gather data from mobile equipment during normal operation at three low-methane coal mines and to estimate the possible magnitude of benefit of three control measures. 188 long duration measurements were obtained from shuttle cars (N = 142, median measurement duration = 3.2 h); personnel transport (N = 24, median measurement duration = 2.4 h); and materials transport vehicles (N = 22, median measurement duration = 1.8 h). Whole-body vibration amplitudes either within or exceeding the ISO health guidance caution zone were consistently measured. In particular, shuttle cars demonstrated whole-body vibration amplitudes which frequently exceeded the health guidance caution zone. The potential effects of roadway maintenance, decreased vehicle speed, and shuttle car seat replacement were found to be practically meaningful.",

    "abstract": "Traffic signs are an integral part of the traffic control plan and they provide road users with necessary information on the upcoming situation. This paper aims to examine the level of understanding of traffic sign imagery used in different countries and to track participants' eye movement when they encounter unfamiliar signs. Tobii eye tracking glasses were used to track gaze differences between familiar and unfamiliar traffic signs. Our findings show that sign characteristics (such as the amount of information on the sign) and the observer's knowledge of the sign meaning have a significant impact on eye behaviour. Signs containing more information (loaded with more content) and unfamiliar to the participant systematically produced the longest overall and average fixations and gazing duration. Given that longer gaze time for unfamiliar traffic signs presents a potential traffic hazard, we evaluated the need for standardization of traffic signs.",

    "abstract": "This study compared farmworkers’ exposure to non-neutral postures using a new mobile platform apple harvesting method and the traditional method using ladders. Twenty-four workers were recruited and assigned into three groups: ladder workers (n = 8) picking apples from full trees using a ladder, mobile platform workers (n = 8) picking apples from upper part of the trees while standing on a moving platform, and ground-based mobile platform workers (n = 8) picking apples from lower part of the trees which the mobile platform workers left out. Upper arm and back inclinations were continuously monitored during harvesting using tri-axial accelerometers over full work shifts (~8 h). Upper arm posture was characterized as the percentage of time that upper arm flexion and abduction exceeded 30°, 60°, and 90°. Back posture was characterized as the percentage of time that torso angles (sagittal flexion or lateral bending) exceeded 10°, 20°, and 30°. The 10th, 50th, and 90th postural percentiles were also calculated. The platform workers had lower exposures to upper arm flexion and abduction than the ground and ladder workers. There were no differences in torso angles between the ladder and mobile platform workers; however, the ground workers were exposed to more and greater percentages of time in torso flexions.",

    "abstract": "This study examined the characteristics of perceived discomfort and postural shifts at different magnitudes during a 4-h sitting period and the association between perceived discomfort and number of postural shifts. Forty healthy participants continuously typed a standardized text passage at a computer work station for 4 h. Subjects rated perceived body discomfort using Borg's CR-10 scale in 10 body regions (i.e. neck, shoulder, elbow, wrist/hand, upper back, lower back, buttock, thigh, knee, and ankle/foot). A seat pressure mat device was used to gather seat pressure data during sitting. Postural shifts were determined by analysis of the dispersion index of both ischial tuberosities from seat pressure data. The threshold for a postural shift was set at ±10% and ±20%. Perceived discomfort in all body regions increased continuously during a 4-h sitting period. The body regions with the highest perceived discomfort were the low back, buttocks, upper back, thigh, and neck. The average (±SD) numbers of postural shifts during the 1st, 2nd, 3rd, and 4th hour of sitting were 14.8 ± 9.5, 17.8 ± 9.4, 18.2 ± 11.1, and 18.1 ± 9.8 shifts per hour for the 10% threshold, and were 4.8 ± 4.4, 6.0 ± 5.6, 7.4 ± 6.7, and 7.7 ± 6.6 shifts per hour for the 20% threshold, respectively. Prolonged sitting led to an increase in perceived musculoskeletal discomfort over time. The number of postural shifts at both magnitudes increased in the first 2 h of sitting and, in the second 2-h period of sitting, only the number of larger postural shifts (with 20% threshold) increased. The findings extend our understanding of sitting behaviors.",

    "abstract": "While there is wide evidence that the occupational use of hand tools increases the risk of musculoskeletal disorder, evidence is limited regarding manual scissors, commonly used by custom tailors for bespoke garment production. We assessed whether scissor design impacts physical demands (muscle activity, perceived discomfort, and wrist posture) and task performance (quality and perceived efficiency). Twenty-four novice volunteers each completed simulated cutting tasks in 24 conditions involving the factorial combinations of four scissor designs (SD), three workstation heights, and two fabric types. SD significantly affected all outcome measures, and differences between SDs were consistent across workstation heights and fabric types. Two wide-handles scissors appeared superior overall, which may be related to the distinct grip type employed with this type of design. These results suggest that careful scissor selection has the potential to both reduce injury risk and enhance performance during fabric cutting tasks, though future testing is needed under more realistic conditions.",

    "abstract": "Cue utilisation and situational awareness share similar properties since both constructs are dependent upon the application of feature-event associations in memory. The aim of this study was to investigate the extent to which cue utilisation and situational awareness contribute to learning a simplified, simulated rail control task incorporating an implicit pattern of train movements. Fifty-five undergraduate students completed an assessment of cue utilisation prior to completing the rail control task during periods of lower and higher task demands. Situational awareness was assessed using Situation Awareness Global Assessment Technique (SAGAT) queries. The results indicated that, while both cue utilisation and situational awareness were related to the detection of the implicit pattern of train movements, they contributed separately to performance on the simulated rail control task. The outcomes suggest that cue utilisation and situational awareness may be separate constructs, where cue utilisation constitutes a capacity variable that is associated with changes in response to task demand and situational awareness constitutes an outcome variable that emerges through task exposure.",

    "doi": "10.1016/j.apergo.2020.103210",
    "abstract": "This paper presents a new handle for instruments used in laparoscopic surgery. This new handle has been designed to provide the best ergonomic and usability features required in this kind of surgical interventions. The main novelty of this handle is that the opening and closing motion of the end-effector is operated with the thumb using a lever located on the top of the handle. This enables the surgeon to reach the patient's organs without adopting extremely awkward postures. In order to demonstrate its advantages, the handle has been tested and compared with another commercial handle in terms of efficiency, effectiveness, and satisfaction. To this end, volunteers have been selected for participation in the experimental evaluation, which comprised two types of surveys: objective and subjective. Electromyography and goniometric studies provide objective parameters for evaluation. Questionnaires are used for the subjective assessment. Outstanding results include the lower level of pain reported by the individuals working with the new handle, as well as the reduction in the hyperflexion of the wrist. Compared with the conventional handle, electromyography reveals that no muscle load is increased when working with the new handle. The results of the subjective survey show that volunteers expressed a significant preference for the new handle, demonstrating an improvement in the ergonomic characteristics.",

A total of 17 young and 17 mature participants were recruited with an average (standard deviation) age of 23.8 (5.0) years and 63.7 (3.9) years, respectively. Participants completed 3 different floor to knuckle lifts before and following 90 min of seated work. The lifts included; (i) 7 kg symmetrical, (ii) 4.5 kg symmetrical and (iii) 4.5 kg asymmetrical. Prolonged seated work and age interacted to affect normalized peak lumbar angles (p = 0.0469) where older adults adopted 56(15)% flexion after seated work compared to 67(16)% among younger adults. Older adults took significantly longer to complete the lifting tasks compared to younger adults while age did not affect perceived effort across lifting tasks. Older workers may require age specific interventions given age specific responses.",

To fill this gap, we examined the sleepiness, sleep, and on-duty sleepiness countermeasures (SCMs) in 23 tram drivers working morning, day, and evening shifts for three weeks. Sleepiness was measured using Karolinska Sleepiness Scale (KSS). Nocturnal total sleep time (TST) was measured with wrist actigraphy. SCMs and naps were self-reported with a smartphone application. Caffeine and napping were considered effective SCMs. Severe sleepiness (KSS ≥ 7) was observed in 22% of shifts with no differences between shift types. Rest breaks were associated with slight reductions in sleepiness. TST between days off averaged 7 h but was 1 h 33 min and 38 min shorter prior to morning and day shifts, respectively. The use of effective SCMs showed little variance between shift types. These results highlight the need for fatigue management in non-night-working tram drivers.",

    "abstract": "Thirty million Americans currently have diabetes, and a substantial portion do not reach the goals of clinical treatment. This is in part due to the complex barriers to effective self-care faced by people with diabetes. This study uses a patient work perspective, focusing on the everyday, lived experience of managing diabetes. Our primary research goal was to explore how the work of self-care is embedded in the other routines of everyday living. We found that everyday objects and spaces were instrumental in the incorporation of diabetes work into daily routines. Objects anchored diabetes tasks by linking illness-specific artifacts to space and time (e.g. a morning routine), and by enabling the performance on diabetes tasks while on the move in either planned or unplanned ways.",

    "abstract": "The aim of the present study was to evaluate the combined effects of noise and air temperature on the human body neurophysiological responses. This study was conducted on 35 male students, who were exposed to four different air temperatures (18 °C, 22 °C, 26 °C, and 30 °C) and two noise levels (55 dBA and 75 dBA) in eight sessions in a simulated indoor environment. The mean values of accuracy and time of response to stimuli in N-back test as well as neurophysiological responses were measured. In the studied experiment configurations, with increasing air temperature and noise, the working memory and neurophysiological responses were disturbed. The results indicated the significant effect of noise on working memory, as compared with that of air temperature. The effects of air temperature on heart rate, respiratory rate as well as theta and alpha bands were more significant than the impact of noise. The combined effects of noise and air temperature were more significant than the influence of each of them alone. In the presence of high noise levels, the increase in air temperature did not worsen the response accuracy. However, in the presence of high noise level, the rise in air temperature aggravated the mean value of neurophysiological responses. Overall, noise has a greater effect on working memory, while the air temperature can disturb neurophysiological responses in a more profound way.",

    "abstract": "This article presents the results of an academic research project connecting the discipline of ergonomics (and work-related issues) with the theme of sustainability. Despite the stated aim of creating value for stakeholders, including employees, companies face difficulties in introducing effective sustainability policies. The research question addressed in this article is the following: How can companies improve their decision-making processes to increase workers' wellbeing using policies integrating issues related to corporate sustainability and ergonomics? Currently, corporate sustainability is focused mainly on the triple bottom line (TBL) concept. In this context, the integration of ergonomics is fragmented and arguably separate from strategic human-resource functions (which have largely been the primary promoter of the internal-social component of corporate sustainability). This research argues that corporate sustainability requires a new step, improving the decision-making process, with the inclusion of more types of rationalities and the recognition of the centrality of workers in the process of creating sustainable action. When corporate sustainability policies focus on worker centrality, they open space for the integration of ergonomics as a pillar of an organization's corporate sustainability strategy. Based on a complex view of work systems, ergonomics can introduce values aligned with sustainability and promote cooperation in organizations. Different stakeholders working at companies can make use of different concepts proposed by ergonomics and other work sciences to support changes in their decision-making processes. In view of broader sustainability objectives, integrating different work-related considerations can help improve performance, including productivity, quality and health.",

    "abstract": "This study investigated the effects of using a single-axis force gauge for push/pull force measurement on kinetic/kinematic measures associated with the exertion and assessed agreement between forces recorded from two technologies (single-axis gauge, three-dimensional hand transducer) and various test conditions via intraclass correlations. Independent measures included exertion type (push, pull, turn), test condition (natural/cart alone, using force gauge at fast/slow/self-selected paces), and cart weight (light, heavy). Dependent measures included mean angles of force application, peak forces recorded from both technologies, and cart velocity. Excellent agreement was observed between technologies (ICC = 0.998). Likewise, peak forces using the single-axis gauge at the fast pace agreed best with the natural test condition (ICC = 0.631). Forces should be measured using a faster initial acceleration and sustained velocity than is prescribed by the current standard if they are to accurately approximate forces relative to existing push/pull guidelines. Future work should also develop recommendations for measuring turning forces.",

Vibrations are delivered to the shoulders, the frontal and dorsal parts of the trunk, by using the human body as an indicator of the four cardinal directions. The device was experimentally tested in normal gravity conditions by thirty-nine volunteers. The efficacy of tactile cues was investigated in comparison to visual and visuo-tactile cues. The results revealed that, despite the fact that the time needed to complete the task was shorter when people were guided by visual signals, the tactile cues were equally informative and, in some cases, the trunk spatial orientation was even more accurate. Overall, tactile cues were evaluated by users as more intuitive, effective and accurate.",

A questionnaire survey (including the Cornell Musculoskeletal Discomfort Questionnaire [CMDQ]) and direct observations of working postures by using the Quick Exposure Check (QEC) method were used at baseline and 12-month follow-up. Shoulder, lower back and neck discomfort were found to be the most common problems. The results showed significant improvements in the frequency (neck, shoulder, lower back, forearm and knee symptoms), severity (shoulder, lower back and knee symptoms) and interference with work (particularly due to lower back symptoms) as well as in the exposure risks to musculoskeletal problems (using the QEC method) after the intervention. The findings support the effectiveness of implemented multiple component intervention for improving musculoskeletal health and exposure risks in the studied occupational group.",

    "abstract": "The built environment is a core part of most healthcare systems, involving a number of requirements such as those related to space and patients’ well-being. However, these are usually addressed separately from other functional requirements, resulting in designs that do not support resilient performance. This study proposes a framework for the integrated modelling of built environment and other functional requirements, relying on two approaches: Functional Resonance Analysis Method (FRAM), and Building Information Modelling (BIM). Requirements are defined as equivalent to the precondition aspect of FRAM functions. BIM allows the creation of a database of requirements and functions, linked to an object-oriented model of the built environment. The proposed framework was devised and tested in an intensive care unit. Findings shed light on the necessary resilience to cope with the gap between built environment-as-imagined in design and built environment-as-done due to performance adjustments. This type of resilience may have a long-lasting nature, as many built environment attributes cannot be easily changed.",

The experimental results show that wheelbarrow load significantly affected muscular activities, hand force, and subject-perceived exertion. Additionally, different ground surfaces and wheelbarrow types also affected the muscular activities of the dominant hand; grass generated the highest muscle load and asphalt pavement generated the smallest muscle load. The user has to apply 57% and 23% more force in the vertical and horizontal direction while pushing one-vs. two-wheeled wheelbarrow. Muscular activity increased significantly in the dominant hand with the one-wheeled wheelbarrow compared with the two-wheeled wheelbarrow, suggesting that, in terms of muscle loads, the two-wheeled wheelbarrow is better than the one-wheeled wheelbarrow.",

    "abstract": "Care transitions across healthcare settings, specifically between the emergency department (ED) and the home, are pervasive among older adults, and represent persistent healthcare quality and safety challenges. Care transitions cross multiple distinct work systems, representing a conceptual and methodological challenge for the field of Human Factors/Ergonomics - how to analyze a process that occurs across multiple work systems. As an initial step in determining how to study care transitions across work systems, we applied the Systems Engineering Initiative for Patient Safety (SEIPS) 2.0 model, specifically the concept of configuration, to explore older adults' ED-to-home transitions. Our results suggest that configuration is useful for identifying and modeling work system barriers that interact across systems, but does not explicitly allow for the identification and analysis of the system boundaries that are crossed. To fully capture the complexity associated with care transitions, future iterations of SEIPS should introduce a mechanism to capture specific boundary types, so that system analysis can capture when and which boundaries are crossed.",

    "abstract": "Ergonomic risk factors, such as excessive physical effort, awkward postures or repetitive movements, were the leading causes of injuries amongst EMS workers in the United States, of which 90% were attributed to lifting, carrying, or transferring a patient and/or equipment. Although the essential tasks of patient handling, transport, and care cannot be eliminated, the design of ambulances and associated equipment is modifiable. Our aims were to identify the extent of Human Factors and Ergonomic (HFE) considerations in existing ambulance design standards/regulations, and describe how HFE and the standards/regulations were applied in the EMS system. Through an extensive environmental scan of jurisdictionally relevant standards/regulations and key informant interviews, our findings demonstrated that existing standards/regulations had limited considerations for HFE. As a result, HFE principles continue to be considered reactively through retrofit rather than proactively in upstream design. We recommend that performance-based HFE requirements be integrated directly into ambulance design standards.",

Performance metrics consisted of hits, misses due to non-detection, misses due to inaccurate engagement, false alarms, response time, navigation errors as well as subjective ratings of mental workload scores were also collected. Results demonstrate the superiority of tactile cues as a means to communicate target location information either as a single modality or when paired with the two other cue types.",

    "abstract": "Existing literature outlines mothers' negative experiences with breast pumps, yet a gap exists of which breast pump characteristics are important to mothers. Identifying which breast pump characteristics are important to breast pumping mothers, and any variation between mothers who do or do not work outside of the home, will help identify user needs. A survey collected information on mothers' experiences with breast pumps and impressions of their characteristics. Latent Class Analysis (LCA) was used to determine whether there were possible groupings of impressions of these characteristics. The LCA identified a two-class model with mothers' age as a significant covariate. Portability, ease of use, low-weight, fast milk extraction, comfortability, low-noise, and discreet were all found to be important to one group of mothers, while only portability, ease of use, fast milk extraction, and comfortability were found to be important to another group of mothers. Mothers' work status was not a significant covariate but did predict class membership when considered as a grouping variable in conjunction with age. Breast pumping mothers' needs were found to differ based on their work status and age together, and collecting and considering these different needs is vital to creating redesigns that improve mothers’ breast pumping experience.",

    "abstract": "Two passive back-support exoskeleton (BSE) designs were assessed in terms of muscular activity, energy expenditure, joint kinematics, and subjective responses. Eighteen participants (gender-balanced) completed repetitive lifting tasks in nine different conditions, involving symmetric and asymmetric postures and using two BSEs (along with no BSE as a control condition). Wearing both BSEs significantly reduced peak levels of trunk extensor muscle activity (by ~9–20%) and reduced energy expenditure (by ~8–14%). Such reductions, though, were more pronounced in the symmetric conditions and differed between the two BSEs tested. Participants reported lower perceived exertion using either BSE yet raised concerns regarding localized discomfort. Minimal changes in lifting behaviors were evident when using either BSE, and use of both BSEs led to generally positive usability ratings. While these results are promising regarding the occupational use of BSEs, future work is recommended to consider inter-individual differences to accommodate diverse user needs and preferences.",

    "abstract": "The purpose of this study was to compare caregiver muscle activation and joint angles between two ergonomic transport chairs designed to mitigate discomfort and safety risks associated with patient transport, the Stryker® Prime TC and the Staxi® Medical Chair, and a depot wheelchair. Twenty-three caregivers completed level walking and ramped tasks with each device and an 84 kg manikin. Surface electromyography for the upper extremities and back muscles and motion data were collected. The Staxi showed a statistical trend for higher wrist extensor and flexor carpi ulnaris activity compared to the Stryker chair (p ≤ 0.078) and greater wrist flexion than the Stryker and depot chairs (p ≤ 0.004). The depot chair showed greater peak trunk flexion than the Stryker chair (p = 0.004). Overall results suggest that ergonomic chair design may improve joint positioning of the trunk and elbows when operating patient transport chairs over level and ramped surfaces.",

    "abstract": "Emergency escape roof hatches are used to evacuate school buses in rolled-over orientations. In the United States, the minimum opening size of a roof hatch is defined by Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard (FMVSS) no. 217. With the prevalence of rising obesity rates among children, the minimum roof hatch opening size may not be large enough to accommodate larger passengers. Post-accident conditions such as injuries, disorientation, and exit obstructions may also prevent unobstructed passage for egress within acceptable time limits. The purpose of this study was to redesign and fabricate a roof hatch with a larger opening and evaluate its egress characteristics for a range of typical school bus passengers. The larger roof hatch opening allows greater evacuation flow rates, and is almost functionally equivalent to the evacuation flow rate of the front door on an upright school bus.",

    "abstract": "This systematic review aimed to evaluate whether muscle activity and playing-related musculoskeletal disorders are associated with musicians’ anthropometrics and their instrument size or set-up during violin and piano performance. Studies were retrieved systematically from six databases on 1 April 2019 combined with hand searching results. The Appraisal tool for Cross-Sectional Studies (AXIS tool) was used to evaluate the methodological quality of the included papers. A total of twenty articles were identified. Most included studies focussed on either the adjustment of the shoulder rest in violinists, or the hand size in pianists. However, methodological quality was inconsistent. The electromyography data reported by the included studies were not appropriately processed and interpreted. Studies generally reported the use of a shoulder rest changes muscle activity and smaller hand size is correlated to increased playing-related musculoskeletal disorders incidence. However, no conclusions can be drawn due to heterogeneity and low quality of methodology in the available literature.",

    "abstract": "Augmented reality (AR) systems are becoming common tools in industrial workplaces. However, factory workers are still concerned about whether head-mounted display (HMD)-based AR systems distract their awareness of the environment and therefore pose safety risks. The purpose of this study was to assess users' experience of real-world awareness when using an AR system. 19 study participants played a wooden block logic game in a laboratory with three different setups: real, AR and virtual reality (VR). Based on this study, it can be concluded that HMD-based AR systems do not decrease users’ awareness of their surroundings if the virtual content is minimal and the task is done while seated. However, it was seen that more research in this area with more interactive virtual content is required. This study is an important step in understanding how AR may affect future work in industrial and safety-critical environments.",

Two hundred ninety-four participants experienced economy class seats in a Boeing 737 with 28-inch, 30-inch, 32-inch and 34-inch seat pitches. Anthropometric measurements of the participants were measured. Participants completed a questionnaire on comfort (10-scale), discomfort (CP-50) and space experience and the results were analysed using SPSS 25. This study showed a significant relationship between seat pitch and comfort as well as discomfort. Additionally, it was found that the mean rank of discomfort of each pitch size for the middle seat was higher than the window and aisle seat, though seat pitch did affect the (dis)comfort more compared with seat location. It was also found that anthropometric sizes significantly affect the (dis)comfort on smaller pitch sizes, and all space experience questions had a correlation to the pitch sizes.",

    "abstract": "Information visualizations may be evaluated from the perspective of how they match tasks that must be performed with them, a cognitive fit perspective. However, there is a gap between the high-level references made to cognitive fit and the low-level ability to identify and measure it during human interaction with visualizations. We bridge this gap by using an electroencephalography metric derived from frontal midline theta power and parietal alpha power, known as the task load index, to determine if cognitive effort measured at the level of cortical activity is less when cognitive fit is present compared to when cognitive fit is not. We found that when there is cognitive fit between the type of problem to be solved and the information displayed by a system, the task load index is lower compared to when cognitive fit is not present. We support this finding with subjective (NASA task load index) and performance (response time and accuracy) measures. Our approach, using electroencephalography, provides supplemental information to self-report and performance measures. Findings from this study are important because they (1) provide more validity to the cognitive fit theory using a neurophysiological measure, and (2) use the electroencephalography task load index metric as a means to assess cognitive workload and effort in general.",

    "title": "Workflow disruptions and provider situation awareness in acute care: An observational study with emergency department physicians and nurses",
    "journal": "Applied Ergonomics",
    "year": "2020",
    "doi": "10.1016/j.apergo.2020.103155",
    "abstract": "Background The fast-paced and rapidly changing environment of an Emergency Department (ED) requires providers to have a high level of situation awareness (SA). However, acute clinical care also encompasses a multitude of interruption-laden work processes that might degrade SA. It is therefore important to understand how frequent interruptions affect ED provider cognition in general and SA in particular. Objective We aimed to examine how sources and contents of provider workflow interruptions influence situation awareness of ED physicians and nurses. Methods This prospective, multi-method study combined standardized observations, self-reports of ED providers, and ED administrative data of staffing and patient load. Expert observers identified ED providers’ workflow interruptions during 90min observation sessions. Afterwards, each provider reported perceived disruptiveness and situation awareness. Controlling for patient load, patient acuity and staffing, we conducted regression analyses to explore prospective associations between interruptions and provider outcomes. Results During 74 observation sessions of overall 110h and 40min, we observed 1205 workflow interruptions (mean rate: 10.9 interruptions/hour). Provider situation awareness was fairly high (M = 7.10; scale 0–10) with no difference between ED physicians and nurses. After controlling for ED workload data, we observed that high rates of interruptions were associated with lower levels of situation awareness (β = −0.27). Further analyses revealed that particularly interruptions by telephone/beeper, technical malfunctions as well as interruptive communication related to completed cases were correlated to low SA. Discussion This study in a naturalistic ED setting shows that ED physicians and nurses continuously cope with disruptions and interruptions. Our findings reveal that highly interruptive workflow environments impede providers' situation awareness. Moreover, it sheds light on specific sources and contents of interruptions that influence providers’ SA in acute care. Conclusion Frequent workflow interruptions can degrade ED providers’ situation awareness. A deeper understanding of how avoidable and unavoidable interruptions affect provider cognitions with particular focus on social and technology-related disruptions is required. Further emphasis should be placed on the effective application of work re-design in this context to foster safe and efficient patient care.",

    "year": "2020",
    "doi": "10.1016/j.apergo.2020.103161",
    "abstract": "Laparoscopic surgery techniques are customarily used in non-invasive procedures. That said traditional surgical instruments and devices used by surgeons suffer from certain ergonomic deficiencies that may lead to physical complaints in upper limbs and back and general discomfort that may, in turn, affect the surgeon’s skills during surgery. A novel design of the laparoscopic gripper handle is presented and compared with one of the most used instruments in this field in an attempt to overcome this problem. The assessment of the ergonomic feature of the novel design was performed by using time–frequency analysis of the surface electromyography (sEMG) signal during dynamic activities. Singular Spectrum Analysis (SSA) was used to decompose the sEMG signal and extract the median frequency of each muscle to assess muscle fatigue. The results reveal that using the proposed ergonomic grip reduces the mean values of the muscle activity during each of the proposed tasks. The novel design also improves the ease of use in laparoscopic surgery as it minimises high-pressure contact areas, reduces large amplitude movements and promotes a neutral position of the hand, wrist and forearm. Furthermore, the SSA method for time–frequency analysis provides a powerful tool to analyse a prescribed activity in ergonomic terms. The proposed methodology to assess muscle activity during surgery activities may be useful in the selection of surgical instruments when programming extended procedures, as it provides an additional selection criterion based on the surgeon’s biomechanics and the proposed activity.",

    "abstract": "Surgery has changed significantly in recent years due to the introduction of advanced technologies, resulting in increased system complexity at the technical, human and organisational levels, which may lead to higher variability of patient outcome due to new error pathways. Current approaches towards a safer surgery are largely based on ex-post analysis of events and process monitoring (e.g. root cause analysis, safety checklists, safety audits). However, adopting a proactive approach enables the prior identification of critical factors and the design of safer sociotechnical systems, thanks to a multi-level (or mesoergnomics) perspective. In this paper, a methodology for performing mesoergonomics analysis of surgical procedures is proposed. It is a methodology for Dynamic Human Reliability Analysis in Robotic Surgery based on a modified version of human error assessment and reduction technique (HEART) integrated with a method for incorporating uncertainties related to the influence of personal and organisational factors on the execution of a surgical procedure. The pilot application involves a robot-assisted radical prostatectomy procedure, and the results reveal that team-related factors have the greatest impact on patient outcome variability.",

    "abstract": "We examined the intraocular pressure responsiveness to oral examination stress, as well as the mediating role of the perceived levels of public speaking anxiety on intraocular pressure changes. Thirty-two university students (intervention group) publicly defended their degree final project, and intraocular pressure and perceived levels of stress were measured before and after the oral presentation, and after 10 min of recovery. The control group (n = 32) was not exposed to any stressful situation, and the dependent measures were taken at the same time points. All participants completed the public speaking anxiety scale. The intervention group exhibited higher intraocular pressure values before the oral presentation (corrected p-values<0.001), with these changes being positively associated with the perceived levels of public speaking anxiety (p < 0.001, r = 0.71). Our results reveal a mediating role of public speaking anxiety on the intraocular pressure responsiveness to oral examination stress, and highlight the utility of intraocular pressure as an indicator of stress in applied situations.",

The aim of present study was to investigate immediate effects of using various insole wedges on activation and co-contraction indices of selected trunk muscles during load lifting. Thirty able-bodied males completed load lifting task using nine various insole wedges. The results showed these significant differences: for normalized mean amplitude of RA muscle between posterior and anterior-medial wedges and for QL muscle between posterior and lateral wedges, for normalized peak amplitude of RA muscle between posterior and anterior-medial wedges, for median frequency of LES muscle between anterior-medial and anterior-lateral wedges, and for co-contraction of RA/TES, RA/LES and RA/MU between posterior and anterior-medial wedges (P = 0.001). These findings should be considered during designation of shoe or insole for work environments.

    "abstract": "Individuals can coordinate small kinematic changes at several degrees of freedom simultaneously in the presence of fatigue, leaving it unclear how overall biomechanical demands at each joint are altered. The purpose of this study was to evaluate trade-offs in joint moments between the trunk, shoulder, and elbow during repetitive upper extremity work. Participants performed four simulated workplace tasks cyclically until meeting fatigue termination criteria. Emergent fatigue-induced adaptations to repetitive work resulted in task-dependent trade-offs in joint moments. In general, reduced shoulder moments were compensated for by increased elbow and trunk joint moment contributions. Although mean joint moment changes were modest (range: 1–3 Nm) across participants, a wide distribution of responses was observed, with standard deviations exceeding 10 Nm. Re-distributing biomechanical demands across joints may alleviate constant tissue loads and facilitate continued task performance with fatigue but may be at the expense of increasing demands at adjacent joints.",

    "abstract": "Several tools have been developed over the past twenty years to assess the degree of driver distraction caused by secondary task engagement. A relatively new and promising method in this area is the box task combined with a detection response task (BT + DRT). However, no evaluation regarding the BT's sensitivity currently exists. Thus, the aim of the present study was to evaluate the BT + DRT by comparing its sensitivity to the sensitivity of already established methods. Twenty-nine participants engaged in several artificial and realistic secondary tasks while either performing the BT + DRT, the Lane Change Test (LCT), or driving through a simple course in a simulator. The results showed that the BT parameters (especially the standard deviation of box position and size) were sensitive to differences in demand across the visual-manual secondary tasks. This was comparable to what was found with the LCT. Surprisingly, the BT performance measures were more sensitive than those of the driving simulation task. The BT + DRT also captured cognitive distraction effects with the integration of the DRT. Hence, the BT + DRT could be a cost-effective method to assess in-vehicle system demand. However, further investigations are necessary to better understand the potential of the BT method.",

    "abstract": "Worn shoes are known to contribute to slip-and-fall risk, a common cause of workplace injuries. However, guidelines for replacing shoes are not well developed. Recent experiments and lubrication theory suggest that the size of the worn region is an important contributor to the shoe tread's ability to drain fluid and therefore the under-shoe friction. This study evaluated a simple test for comparing the size of the worn region relative to a common object (AAA and AA battery) as a means of determining shoe replacement. This study consisted of three components involving slip-resistant shoes: Experiment #1: a longitudinal, mechanical, accelerated wear experiment; Experiment #2: a longitudinal experiment where the same shoes were tested after each month of worker use; and Experiment #3: a cross-sectional experiment that exposed participants to a slippery condition, while donning their own worn shoes. The COF (Experiments #1 and #2); under-shoe fluid pressure (all experiments); and slip severity (Experiment #3) were compared across outcomes (fail/pass) of the battery tests. Larger fluid pressures, lower coefficient of friction, and more severe slips were observed for shoes that failed the battery tests compared with those passing the tests. This method offers promise for assessing loss in friction and an increase in slip risk for slip-resistant shoes.",

    "abstract": "This study aimed to characterize the biomechanical stresses in the neck and shoulder, self-reported discomfort, and usability by different target distance or size during augmented reality (AR) interactions. In a repeated-measures laboratory-based study, 20 participants (10 males) performed three standardized AR tasks (3-dimensional (3-D) cube, omni-directional pointing, and web-browsing tasks) with three target distances (0.3, 0.6, and 0.9 m from each participant denoted by near, middle, far targets) for the 3-D cube and omni-directional pointing tasks or three target sizes: small (30% smaller than default), medium (default: 1.0 × 1.1 m), and large (30% larger than default) for the web-browsing task. Joint angle, joint moment, muscle activity, self-reported discomfort and comfort in the neck and shoulders; and subjective usability ratings were measured. The results showed that shoulder angle (flexion and abduction), shoulder moment (flexion), middle deltoid muscle activity significantly increased as the target distance increased during the 3-D cube task (p's < 0.001). Self-reported neck and shoulder discomfort significantly increased after completing each task (p's < 0.001). The participants preferred the near to middle distance (0.3–0.6 m) or the medium to large window size due to task easiness (p's < 0.005). The highest task performance (speed) was occurred at the near distance or the large window size during the 3-D cube and web-browsing tasks (p's < 0.001). The results indicate that AR interactions with the far target distance (close to maximum reach envelop) may increase the risk for musculoskeletal discomfort in the shoulder regions. Given the increased usability and task performance, the near to middle distance (less than 0.6 m) or the medium to large window size (greater than 1.0 × 1.1 m) would be recommended for AR interactions.",

    "abstract": "Real-time risk assessment for work-related musculoskeletal disorders (MSD) has been a challenging research problem. Previous methods such as using depth cameras suffered from limited visual range and wearable sensors could cause intrusiveness to the workers, both of which are less feasible for long-run on-site applications. This document examines a novel end-to-end implementation of a deep learning-based algorithm for rapid upper limb assessment (RULA). The algorithm takes normal RGB images as input and outputs the RULA action level, which is a further division of RULA grand score. Lifting postures collected in laboratory and posture data from Human 3.6 (a public human pose dataset) were used for training and evaluating the algorithm. Overall, the algorithm achieved 93% accuracy and 29 frames per second efficiency for detecting the RULA action level. The results also indicate that using data augmentation (a strategy to diversify the training data) can significantly improve the robustness of the model. The proposed method demonstrates its high potential for real-time on-site risk assessment for the prevention of work-related MSD.

    "doi": "10.1016/j.apergo.2020.103118",
    "abstract": "Prolonged driving could induce neuromuscular fatigue and discomfort since drivers have little opportunity to adjust their position. However, better car seat design could play a major role in limiting these effects. This study compared the effect of two different seats (S - soft and F - firm) on neuromuscular fatigue and driver's perceived discomfort during prolonged driving, also assessing the effect of different road types on neuromuscular activity. Twenty participants performed two 3-h driving sessions, one for each seat, on a static simulator. Every 20 min, participants self-evaluated their level of whole-body and individual body-area discomfort. Surface electromyography (sEMG) was recorded for eight muscles including Trapezius descendens (TD), Erector spinae longissimus (ESL), Multifidus (MF), Vastus lateralis (VL) and Tibialis anterior (TA) throughout the driving sessions. Moreover, an endurance static test (EST) was performed prior to and after each driving session. Whole-body discomfort increased with time with both seats, but no difference in discomfort scores was observed between seats throughout the driving sessions. The highest discomfort scores were for neck and lower back areas with both seats. Neuromuscular fatigue was revealed by a shorter endurance time in post-driving EST for both seats. EMG recordings showed different neuromuscular fatigue profiles for the two seats, with earlier onset of fatigue for S. Despite the lack of difference in perceived discomfort level, the two seats have different impacts: the softness of S induces greater activity of the lower back muscles, while F offers greater support for the lower back.",

    "abstract": "This paper compares clinician hand motion for common suturing tasks across a range of experience levels and tissue types. Medical students (32), residents (41), attending surgeons (10), and retirees (2) were recorded on digital video while suturing on one of: foam, pig feet, or porcine bowel. Depending on time in position, each medical student, resident, and attending participant was classified as junior or senior, yielding six experience categories. This work focuses on trends associated with increasing tenure observed from those medical students (10), residents (15), and attendings (10) who sutured on foam, and draws comparison across tissue types where pertinent. Utilizing custom software, the two-dimensional location of each of the participant's hands were automatically recorded in every video frame, producing a rich spatiotemporal feature set. While suturing on foam, increasing clinician experience was associated with conserved path length per cycle of the non-dominant hand, significantly reducing from junior medical students (mean = 73.63 cm, sd = 33.21 cm) to senior residents (mean = 46.16 cm, sd = 14.03 cm, p = 0.015), and again between senior residents and senior attendings (mean = 30.84 cm, sd = 14.51 cm, p = 0.045). Despite similar maneuver rates, attendings also accelerated less with their non-dominant hand (mean = 16.27 cm/s2, sd = 81.12 cm/s2, p = 0.002) than senior residents (mean = 24.84 cm/s2, sd = 68.29 cm/s2, p = 0.002). While tying, medical students moved their dominant hands slower (mean = 4.39 cm/s, sd = 1.73 cm/s, p = 0.033) than senior residents (mean = 6.53 cm/s, sd = 2.52 cm/s). These results suggest that increased psychomotor performance during early training manifest through faster dominant hand function, while later increases are characterized by conserving energy and efficiently distributing work between hands. Incorporating this scalable video-based motion analysis into regular formative assessment routines may enable greater quality and consistency of feedback throughout a surgical career.",

    "abstract": "Despite recent concerns for workers’ health, exposure situations to nanoparticles can occur in numerous workplaces. Understanding how exposures occur considering human work in these transformations remains a crucial issue of nanotechnologies. The objective of this article is to understand exposure situations to nanoparticles, their determinants and the resources to act on them. This understanding was achieved by specific measurement of nanoparticles aerosols, combined with an analysis of work activity (actions performed and physical strain) in a rubber industry. The presentation of real time measurements, associated with the video of work situations, during confrontation interviews becomes a means of making exposing work activities visible, to analyze and transform them from the points of view formulated by the company's stakeholders. In this way, characterized “typical exposure situations” serve to trigger discussions and open up new spaces for debate highlighting how innovation affects work and gives rise to enhanced prevention projects.",

Analyses were informed by data generated through observations of 12 care coordination clinic visits within a pediatric complex care program, semi-structured interviews of 11 family caregivers, and reviews of program documents. Our results show that family caregivers: (1) formulate medication management goals, identify values and criteria to judge goals but these may not necessarily be acknowledged and explicitly supported by system resources and healthcare professionals (2) are engaged in a range of complex medication management tasks that are both physically and emotionally demanding without the support of well-designed tools and resources to enhance their work.",

In this study, we used a patient-centered cognitive task analysis (P-CTA) to develop self-care decision-making personas. We collected data from 24 older adults with chronic heart failure and 14 support persons, using critical incident and fictitious scenario interviews. Qualitative analyses produced three personas but revealed that individuals exemplify different personas across situations. The Rule-Following persona seeks clear rules, exercises caution under uncertainty, and grounds actions in confidence in clinician experts. The Researching persona seeks information to gain better understanding, invents strategies, and conducts experiments independently or with clinicians. The Disengaging persona does not actively seek rules or information and does not attempt to reduce uncertainty or conduct experiments. We discuss the situational nature of personas, their use in design, and the benefits of P-CTA for studying patient decision making.",

Twenty caregivers (18 females and 2 males) performed standardized patient turning tasks with two simulated patients (body mass: 74 kg and 102 kg). The turning tasks were performed in two turning directions (toward vs. away relative to caregivers) using five device conditions: draw sheet, friction-reducing turning sheet, air-assisted transfer device, air-assisted turning device, and no assistive device. Low back and upper extremity muscle activity, trunk and shoulder postures, low back moment, and self-reported usability ratings were evaluated. While all assistive devices reduced trunk flexion, both air-assisted transfer and turning devices reduced the trunk flexion (p's < 0.001) and muscle activity (p's < 0.001) in the erector spinae and triceps compared to no assistive device condition. These results suggest that the air-assisted devices have potential as an effective intervention to considerably reduce physical risk factors associated with caregivers' musculoskeletal disorders in low back and upper extremities.",

    "abstract": "Over the years, the industry’s interest in using external support devices, such as exoskeletons, is increasing. They are introduced as a new technique for improving the conditions of workers and for reducing the risk of musculoskeletal injuries. An investigation of muscle activity, Jonsson’s (Jonsson, 1982) ergonomic acceptance ranges, and shoulder range of motion was conducted with a sample of 12 workers using an upper extremity exoskeleton in an automotive assembly line. The operators performed continuous cycles of dynamic overhead work consisting of the assembly of the car body at the underside of the car making use of pneumatic screwdrivers. The EMGs (anterior part of deltoid, trapezius, latissimus dorsi and erector spinae) were measured for the muscle activity analysis on the one hand, and for the ergonomics study on the other hand. The latter consisted of an approach based on Jonsson’s work, that establishes acceptance thresholds of cumulative percentage of maximum voluntary contraction of muscle activity (%MVC) in a work cycle. The joint angles motion capture was carried out by measuring the angles of the neck, back, and arms joints. All measurements were performed during experimental sessions with and without an exoskeleton. The key findings show reductions of 34% and 18% of the deltoid and the trapezius muscular activities, respectively, which in turn could lead to a reduction of discomfort and fatigue. The erector spinae and latissimus dorsi muscles were not significantly affected by exoskeleton. The values of muscular activity were also represented over Jonsson’s acceptance areas. Referring to the posture, some differences were found in the range of movement of back, neck, and arms owing to the use of the exoskeleton; however, the differences were smaller than 5% in all cases.",

    "abstract": "Stairs are associated with falls, especially when step dimensions are inconsistent. However, the mechanisms by which inconsistencies cause this higher risk are mostly theoretical. In this experimental study we quantified the effect of inconsistent rise heights on biomechanical measurements of stepping safety from younger (n = 26) and older adults (n = 33). In ascent, both groups decreased foot clearance (~9 mm) over the inconsistently higher step (F(1,56) = 48.4, p < 0.001). In descent, they reduced foot contact length on the higher step by 3% (F(1,56) = 9.1, p < 0.01). Reduced clearance may result in a toe-catch potentially leading to a trip, while reduced foot contact lengths increase the risk of overstepping which may also lead to a fall. These effects occurred because participants did not alter their foot trajectories, indicating they either did not detect or were not able to adjust to the inconsistent rise, increasing the likelihood of a fall. Consistent stair construction is vital, and existing inconsistencies should be identified and safety interventions developed.",

    "abstract": "Resilient healthcare emphasises the importance of adaptive capacity in quality healthcare. This theory has had extensive theoretical development, but comparatively limited translation for clinicians in practice. This study is the first to present resilient healthcare principles in a serious video game. Serious games are an effective tool for engaging users, sharing ideas and eliciting reflections. The aim of this study was to communicate principles from resilient healthcare to clinicians through a serious video game, and to evaluate the game's feasibility as a prompt to reflect on practice. The game, Resilience Challenge, is scenario-based and requires players to resolve dilemmas in clinical practice. It was disseminated online, and was played 1949 times during the four-month study. The game was evaluated using an immediate cross-sectional survey, which included both Likert-style and free text responses. Participants reported that the game was engaging (93%) and that they would recommend it to others (89%). Fewer participants reported learning about resilient healthcare concepts (64%). Resilience Challenge is a promising way to prompt reflections about clinical work, and demonstrates mixed outcomes in communicating resilient healthcare principles to clinicians.",

    "abstract": "The common cause hypothesis, as applied here, proposes that similar networks of influencing factors may contribute to both adverse outcomes and near misses. This hypothesis has not been evaluated using a systems-thinking perspective. The aims of this study are to evaluate whether networks of contributory and protective factors exist within aviation serious near miss reports and to determine if the common cause hypothesis is applicable in this context. Sixteen incident reports from French civil aviation crash investigation bureau were analysed using the AcciMap method. Contributory and protective factors, and relationships between both were identified via coding of the reports. The results indicate that considering protective factors support a richer picture of incidents and provide support for the common cause hypothesis as measured by similar mean factor volume and sociotechnical levels for both contributory and protective factors. However, the findings also show the direction of relationships among protective and contributory factors may be indicative of a difference among adverse outcomes, near misses, and normal work. Future research should consider how a network of relationships may impact on the common contributory and protective factors found in near misses.",

    "abstract": "There is a growing need for resilience in dealing with unexpected events during disasters. The purpose of this review was to summarize and synthesize the literature that examined resilience in the context of emergency management (EM). Four groups of findings were synthesized: definitions, key dimensions, technical tools, and research settings employed in the research. First, definitions of resilience, improvisation, and adaptation were summarized and critically evaluated. Second, four key dimensions of EM resilience were identified: collective sensemaking, team decision making, harmonizing work-as-imagined and work-as-done, and interaction and coordination. Third, this review identified five prevalent technical tools used to enhance resilience in EM: mapmaking, event history logging, mobile communication applications, integrated information management system, and decision support tools. Fourth, two major design features of emergency simulations, incident scenarios and participant roles, are evaluated. For each finding, directions for future research efforts to improve resilience in EM are proposed.",

    "abstract": "This study investigated the muscle strength and performance fatigability of the forearms in eight male orthopaedic surgeons when performing bone screw fixations. Each surgeon performed an eight-bone screws operations in a porcine femur model to simulate fractural fixation using plating technique. The pre- and post-fatigue maximum isometric forces and corresponding electromyography responses were measured to assess the forearm muscle strength loss and fatigue due to screwing. Results showed that after eight bone screws were inserted, the maximal grip force, maximal driving torque and maximal push force losses were approximately 29%, 20% and 23%, respectively. While the grip force and/or driving torque acting, both the brachioradialis and extensor carpi ulnaris had a higher percentage change of EMG than the biceps brachii. The driving forces decreased with the number of screw insertions; however, the insertion time increased parabolically with the number of screws and significantly decreased the insertion rate of the screws, indicating that forearm muscle fatigue may occur in surgeons who treat fracture fixation using more than eight bone screws.",

    "abstract": "Improving vibration-induced discomfort often requires a reduction in the vibration experienced by vehicle occupants. Simulation software and test equipment are able to measure changes in vibration that are too small for humans to perceive. It is therefore important to know how large the change in vibration should be, i.e. the difference threshold, for occupants to perceive an improvement in comfort. This study estimates difference thresholds for ten automotive engineers seated in a vehicle on a 4-poster test rig. Participants were exposed to multi-axis vibration. Component ride values were calculated by applying BS 6841 frequency weightings and multiplication factors to seat accelerations in the six directions. Difference thresholds were estimated for two road profiles using the vertical component ride value and combined point ride value (i.e. the root-sums-of-squares of the six component ride values). The two road profiles had different magnitudes, but the same spectral shape, resulting in median vertical component ride values of 0.58 and 1.01 m.s.−2, root-mean-square. An up-down transformed response rule was used with a three-down-one-up response grouping to estimate difference thresholds at a 79.4% probability level. The median relative difference threshold for the two roads was 10.13% and 8.58% considering the vertical component ride value, and 10.99% and 9.24% considering the combined point ride value. No statistically significant difference was found between the medians of the relative difference threshold over the two roads considering either of the two ride values (p-value = 0.995 in both instances), suggesting that Weber's law holds.",

    "abstract": "Resilience principles show promise for improving the quality of healthcare, but there is a need for further theoretical development to include all levels and scales of activity across the whole healthcare system. Many existing models based on engineering concepts do not adequately address the prominence of social, cultural and organisational factors in healthcare work. Promising theoretical developments include the four resilience potentials, the CARE model and the Moments of Resilience Model, but they are all under specified and in need of further elaboration. This paper presents the Integrated Resilience Attributes Framework in which these three theoretical perspectives are integrated to provide examples of anticipating, responding, monitoring and learning at different scales of time and space. The framework is intended to guide researchers in researching resilience, especially the linkages between resilience at different scales of time and space across the whole healthcare system.",

    "doi": "10.1016/j.apergo.2020.103122",
    "abstract": "Patient lateral transfers between two adjacent surfaces pose high musculoskeletal disorder risks for nurses and patient handlers. The purpose of this research was to examine the ergonomic benefits of utilizing the laterally-tilting function of operating room (OR) tables during such transfers – along with different friction-reducing devices (FRD). This method allows the patient to slide down to the adjacent surface as one nurse guides the transfer and another controls the OR table angle with a remote control. Sixteen nursing students and sixteen college students were recruited to act as nurses and patients, respectively. Two OR table angles were examined: flat and tilted. Three FRD conditions were considered: a standard blanket sheet, a plastic bag, and a slide board. Electromyography (EMG) activities were measured bilaterally from the posterior deltoids, upper trapezii, latissimus dorsi, and lumbar erector spinae muscles. The Borg-CR10 scale was used for participants to rate their perceived physical exertions. The efficiency of each method was measured using a stopwatch. Results showed that the tilted table technique completely replaced the physical efforts that would have been exerted by the pushing-nurse, in that muscle activation did not increase in the pulling-nurse. On the contrary, EMG activities of the pulling-nurse for most of the muscles significantly decreased (p < 0.05). The subjective Borg-ratings also favored the tilted table with significantly lower ratings. However, the tilted table required on average 7.22 s more than the flat table to complete the transfer (p < 0.05). The slide board and plastic bag were associated with significantly lower Borg-ratings and EMG activities for most muscles than blanket sheet, but they both were not significantly different from each other. However, they each required approximately 5 s more than the blanket sheet method to complete the patient transfer (p < 0.05). By switching from flat + blanket sheet to tilted + slide board, EMG activities in all muscles decreased in the range of 18.4–72.3%, and Borg-ratings decreased from about 4 (somewhat difficult) to 1 (very light). The findings of this study propose simple, readily available ergonomic interventions for performing patient lateral transfers that can have significant implications for nurses’ wellbeing and efficiency.",

    "abstract": "This study evaluated the effectiveness of ergonomic interventions in material handling operations involving 33 employers and 535 employees from 2012 to 2017. Outcomes included employee-reported low back/upper extremity pain and safety incidents at baseline, every three months, and annually for up to two years. A total of 32.5% of employees completed at least one survey, while 13.6% completed all nine surveys over two years. Among highly exposed employees (who reported handling >= 50 lbs. > 33% of the time), upper extremity pain frequency and severity were lower among those who reported using the intervention routinely versus those that reported using their body strength alone to handle objects >= 50 lbs. After excluding from analyses one employer that used anti-fatigue mats, low back pain frequency was also significantly lower among highly exposed intervention users. In conclusion, there was some evidence that the interventions were effective in reducing employee-reported pain for highly exposed employees.",

    "abstract": "Women experience higher prevalence of work-related upper limb musculoskeletal disorders compared to men. Previous studies have investigated the biological, kinematic and electromyographic sex-related differences during a lifting task but the actual differences in musculoskeletal loads remain unknown. We investigated the sex differences in three musculoskeletal indicators: the sum of muscle activations, the sum of muscle forces and the relative time spent beyond a shear-compression dislocation ratio. A musculoskeletal model was scaled on 20 women and 20 men lifting a 6 or 12kg box from hip to eye level. Women generated more muscle forces and activations than men, regardless of the lifted mass. Those differences occurred when the box was above shoulder level. In addition, women might spend more time beyond a shear-compression dislocation ratio. Our work suggests higher musculoskeletal loads among women compared to men during a lifting task, which could be the result of poor technique and strength difference.",

A Thermal Simulation System was developed in this study to precisely control the surface temperature of shell materials to simulate various end-use conditions. Seventeen participants were asked to contact the plates with their fingers and rate their thermal sensation using the magnitude estimation approach. Results showed that thermal sensation magnitude and plate temperature followed a power function. The differences in sensation magnitude can be attributed to the thermal inertias of different materials. The findings suggested that laminated plate was generally perceived cooler when heated. Given that the surface temperature of plate is higher than skin, the thermal sensation magnitude increases with contact duration.",

    "abstract": "Women experience higher prevalence of work-related upper limb musculoskeletal disorders compared to men. Previous studies have investigated the biological, kinematic and electromyographic sex-related differences during a lifting task but the actual differences in musculoskeletal loads remain unknown. We investigated the sex differences in three musculoskeletal indicators: the sum of muscle activations, the sum of muscle forces and the relative time spent beyond a shear-compression dislocation ratio. A musculoskeletal model was scaled on 20 women and 20 men lifting a 6 or 12kg box from hip to eye level. Women generated more muscle forces and activations than men, regardless of the lifted mass. Those differences occurred when the box was above shoulder level. In addition, women might spend more time beyond a shear-compression dislocation ratio. Our work suggests higher musculoskeletal loads among women compared to men during a lifting task, which could be the result of poor technique and strength difference.",

    "abstract": "This systematic review and meta-analysis identified and critically reviewed the findings of recent studies (last 15 years) examining relationships between specific physically demanding occupations or occupational tasks and development of lower limb osteoarthritis (OA). Twenty-eight studies with 266,227 cases of lower limb OA were included. Occupational tasks contributing to OA included farming, floor laying, and brick laying. Activities significantly contributing to the risk of knee OA were lifting heavy loads (>10 kg/week) (odds ratio [OR] = 1.52, 95% confidence interval [95%CI] 1.29–1.79), squatting/kneeling (OR = 1.69, 95%CI 1.15–2.49), standing (>2 h/daily) (OR = 1.22 95%CI 1.02–1.46) and walking (OR = 1.40 95%CI 1.14–1.73). Lifting contributed significantly to the risk of hip OA (OR = 1.35, 95%CI 1.16–1.57). The effects of occupational exposures appear to be magnified by previous injury and BMI >25 kg/m2. Since specific occupational activities increase OA risk, ergonomist should encourage the use of existing tools, or oversee the design of new tools that may decrease exposure to such activities.",

In this study, we examine decision quality and visual information foraging for DSSs with different known reliability levels. Thirty-six participants completed a financial fraud detection task, first unsupported and then supported by a DSS which highlighted important information sources. Participants were randomly allocated to four cohorts, being informed that the system's reliability was 100%, 90%, 80% or undisclosed. Results showed that only a DSS known to be 100% reliable resulted in participants systematically following its suggestions, increasing the percentage of correct classifications to a median of 100% while halving both, decision time and number of visually attended information sources. In all other conditions, the DSS had no effect on most visual sampling metrics, while decision quality of the human-DSS team was below the reliability level of the DSS. Knowledge of an even slightly unreliable system hence had a profound impact on joint decision making, with participants trusting their significantly worse performance more than the DSSs suggestions.",

    "year": "2020",
    "doi": "10.1016/j.apergo.2020.103083",
    "abstract": "Background Masons have a high rate of musculoskeletal disorders among construction workers and greater than all other industries. Viable solutions to musculoskeletal hazards have been identified by industry stakeholders, yet masons receive minimal ergonomics training. Apprentices, as the next generation of masons, need training and strategies to identify and speak up about ergonomic and safety issues on job sites. To fill this gap, our team developed the Safety Voice for Ergonomics (SAVE) training program. Methods The interactive, 7-unit SAVE program was developed specifically for masonry brick and block apprentices. This innovative training contains detailed ergonomics lessons focusing on risk factors and solutions specific to this masonry craft. It also contains lessons that provide communication and problem solving strategies. Evaluation of SAVE employed a randomized control trial designed to assess the effectiveness of SAVE for apprentices over a six-month period. Results Our findings demonstrated that compared to controls, SAVE trained apprentices used their safety voice more (P = .049) and had greater safety participation (P = .028). They adopted more ergonomic practices such as adjusting scaffolding (P = .016) and using better body postures (P = 042). Apprentices liked SAVE and indicated that it prompted them to change workplace safety behaviors. Conclusions SAVE is an effective program, providing needed ergonomic and safety communication training for workers as they begin their trade. The broad adoption of SAVE training by the masonry industry has the potential to empower apprentices, elevate the trade's safety culture, and ultimately reduce musculoskeletal disorders.",

How do these patients challenge existing ways of organising tasks, clinical activities, and interdependent responsibilities? The current study applies a sociotechnical systems perspective to understand how these complex work design and care-related challenges were resolved by the Western Australian Undiagnosed Diseases Program. We conducted a two-year longitudinal, qualitative study of this program, conceived to improve the diagnosis and management of patients with rare, multi-system disorders by piloting a re-design of the local system of diagnostic work. Specifically, we (1) compared the configuration and effectiveness of the old system and the re-designed system; and (2) analysed the process of system re-design (i.e., the design, implementation, and operation of the program) in order to understand the factors that contributed to – or inhibited – its success. We discuss the theoretical and practical implications of our findings for effectively re-designing complex, trans-organisational work systems.",

    "abstract": "Background Due to the demographic challenge in most countries it is important to consider making work life sustainable. A sustainable work life is of importance in all age groups when working life will be extended to a higher age. Aim Towards a theoretical model with an impact on a sustainable working life for all ages, the swAge - model. Method The theoretical model, the swAge-model, is developed based on grounded theory using qualitative studies, quantitative studies, intervention projects and literature reviews. Result The swAge-model states the interactions between different ageing concepts; chronological, mental, biological and social ageing, and the nine areas of importance for individuals’ work life participation. The model also states the four consideration areas whether individuals can and want to participate in an extended working life or not. The model also includes proposed measures at the organisation/enterprise level and at the society level based on the four activity areas at the individual level. Conclusion The theoretical swAge-model describes how to reflect on working life and presents tools to extend work life in a sustainable way for older workers in modern society. The swAge-models’ analysis and measure matrix is included as appendix 1. In the Nordic countries the theoretical model is use in the critical debate and as a tool for managers and authorities to make the working life sustainable for all ages.",

    "year": "2020",
    "doi": "10.1016/j.apergo.2020.103096",
    "abstract": "This paper: identifies personal and contextual factors that influence customer experience when service failures occur in rail transport; what is being conveyed through that factor (e.g. older age being used to convey vulnerability); and the implications for future service design. The results are from a thematic analysis of free-text rail passenger complaints (n = 516) reporting service failures that impacted on customer experience. The study differs from existing research on the pertinent personal and contextual factors for public transport service provision in that it: focuses on the passenger experience resulting from specific incidents (rather than evaluative, overall assessments of satisfaction), generates the factors inductively from the data (rather than a-priori) and uses detailed qualitative cases (rather than quantitative survey data). The findings (1) identify some similar factors to those used in previous research and uncover some new factors for both person and context, (2) provide an understanding of what they mean in terms of the passenger experience and (3) indicate how the factors might need to be measured if they are to be used by the rail industry. The paper concludes by using the outcome of an industry-based validation exercise to describe how the findings could be used in future rail services, namely: predicting where the customer experience is going to be sub-optimal, prioritising responses to particular circumstances, and designing services to better meet customer's needs. This exploratory research is timely, given the need for a more passenger-centric approach to service design and future developments such as smart-ticketing, which could potentially enable greater understanding of who is using the rail network and for what journeys.",

    "year": "2020",
    "doi": "10.1016/j.apergo.2020.103094",
    "abstract": "Using a simulated X-ray screening task, we tested 122 airport security screeners working with the support of explosives detection systems for cabin baggage screening (EDSCB) as low-level automation. EDSCB varied systematically on three automation reliability measures: accuracy, d', and positive predictive value (PPV). Results showed that when unaided performance was high, operator confidence was high, and automation provided only small benefits. When unaided performance was lower, operator confidence was lower, and automation with higher d' provided large benefits. Operator compliance depended on the PPV of automation: We found lower compliance for lower PPV. Automation with a high false alarm rate of 20% and a low PPV of .3 resulted in operators ignoring about one-half of the true automation alarms on difficult targets—a strong cry-wolf effect. Our results suggest that automation reliability described by d' and PPV is more valid than using accuracy alone. When the PPV is below .5, operators should receive clear instructions on how to respond to automation alarms.",

    "abstract": "Current industrial production systems allow assembly of customised products which include additional elements distinguishing them from a reference model. This customisation can result in significant additional time constraints which compel workers to complete their tasks faster, which may pose problems for older workers. The objective of this laboratory study was to investigate the impact of restrictive or flexible pacing during assembly of customised products among groups of younger and older participants. The data gathered were used to analyse cycle-time, assembly performance, muscular load, and kinematic adaptations. The flexible pacing condition was found to improve production performance, increasing customised assembly cycle-time and reducing biomechanical load, for both young and older participants. However, as the task required fine manual dexterity, older participants were subjected to a higher biomechanical load, even in the flexible pacing scenario. These results should encourage assembly-line designers to allow flexible time constraints as much as possible and to be particularly attentive to the needs of older workers.",

    "abstract": "Phishing is a social engineering tactic where a malicious actor impersonates a trustworthy third party with the intention of tricking the user into divulging sensitive information. Previous social engineering research in a real-world setting has shown an interaction between the personality of the target and the persuasion principle used. This study investigated whether this interaction is present in the realm of email phishing. Additionally, a signal detection theory framework was used to evaluate how the various persuasion principles influence accuracy, sensitivity (d’), and response criterion placement. A personality inventory and an email identification task (phishing or legitimate) were used. These data support previous findings that high extroversion is predictive of increased susceptibility to phishing attacks. The various persuasions principles elicited diverse response criterions and sensitivities, though all investigated persuasion principles resulted in a liberal decision criterion, except one. These findings are interpreted and discussed.",

The study aims to explore the dynamic interactions of stakeholders and work system elements in the medication administration process in a nursing home ward. Data were collected using observations and interviews. A deductive content analysis led to a SEIPS-based process map and an accompanying work system analysis. The study increases knowledge of the complexity of the medication administration process by portraying the dynamic interactions between the major stakeholders in the work system, and the temporal flow of the activities involved. Secondly, it identifies facilitators and barriers in the work system linked to the medication administration process. Most barriers and facilitators are associated with the work system elements – tools & technology, organisation and tasks – and occur early in the medication administration process.",

The package consists of the RAMP tool (Risk Assessment and Management tool for manual handling Proactively), the RAMP website, and free, globally available online, training courses (MOOCs). An Action module used for managing identified MSD risks is introduced. The tool, encompassing a wide range of risks, is applicable to the whole risk management process. Furthermore, RAMP is openly available for download, and free to use. The RAMP tool and training materials were developed using a participative iterative methodology including researchers and practitioners. RAMP was downloaded in 86 countries in the first 26 months since its' launch and over 2400 learners from high-, middle- and low-income countries have joined the MOOCs. The RAMP Package meets organisations’ needs for an accessible, comprehensive risk assessment and management tool.",

    "abstract": "Systems contradictions present challenges that need to be effectively managed, e.g. due to conflicting rules and advice, goal conflicts, and mismatches between demand and capacity. We apply FRAM (Functional Resonance Analysis Method) to intravenous infusion practices in an intensive care unit (ICU) to explore how tensions and contradictions are managed by people. A multi-disciplinary team including individuals from nursing, medical, pharmacy, safety, IT and human factors backgrounds contributed to this analysis. A FRAM model investigation resulting in seven functional areas are described. A tabular analysis highlights significant areas of performance variability, e.g. administering medication before a prescription, prioritising drugs, different degrees of double checking and using sites showing early signs of infection for intravenous access. Our FRAM analysis has been non-normative: performance variability is not necessarily wanted or unwanted, it is merely necessary where system contradictions cannot be easily resolved and so adaptive capacity is required to cope.",

    "abstract": "Recently, several spinal exoskeletons were developed with the aim to assist occupational tasks such as load-handling and work in prolonged static postures. While the biomechanical effects of such devices has been well investigated, only limited feedback to the developers is usually provided regarding the subjective perceptions of the end-users. The aim of this study was to present a novel battery of tests, designed to assess functional performance and subjective outcomes during the use of assistive trunk exoskeletons, and to assess its test-retest reliability. The battery of tests consists of 12 different simple functional tasks. Twenty participants were included in an intra-session reliability test and repeated the tests within 7–10 days to assess inter-session reliability. They were wearing a novel passive spinal exoskeleton during all trials. The outcomes included quantitative and subjective measures, such as performance time and rating of discomfort and perceived task difficulty. The majority of the outcome measures were reliable within session and between sessions (ICC or α > 0.80). Systematic effects were observed in a few tasks, suggesting that familiarization trials will be needed to minimize the learning effects. The novel battery of tests could become an important easy-to-use tool for functional testing of the spinal exoskeletons in addition to more specific biomechanical and physiological testing. Further studies should address the reliability of the present battery of tests for assessing specific populations, such as low back pain patients and explore how to minimize systematic effects that were observed in this study.",

    "abstract": "Occupants of autonomous vehicle have frequently indicated the desire to sleep or rest while driving, yet little has been known regarding the suitable design criteria for a biomechanically reasoned in-vehicle sleeping position. This study was aimed at evaluating the biomechanical quality of different backrest and seat pan angle combinations, and at predicting the most favourable sleeping positions based on vehicle restriction. More specifically, the interface pressure distribution and subjective suitability rating of 23 subjects was assessed in a total of nine (3 × 3) combinations of seat pan (20°, 30°, 40°) and backrest (145°, 155°, 165°) angles. Biomechanical quality was evaluated with an interface pressure score (IPS) based on sensitivity weighted pressures and the total contact area. Two-way repeated measures ANOVA revealed that IPS significantly improves with increasing seat pan angle whereas backrest angles of 155° or 165° lead to significant better IPS compared to flatter ones (145°). The overall highest IPS was observed for a 40°-seat pan angle in combination with a 155°-backrest angle. Subjective suitability rating revealed that people prefer a combination of 165° backrest angle with a seat pan of 20°; however, eight of nine combinations can be considered as suitable for sleeping. Therefore, the combination of a 40°-seat pan angle and 155° backrest is recommended by the present study for an in-vehicle sleeping position due to the increased biomechanical quality.",

    "abstract": "Soft exoskeletons apply compressive forces at the limbs via connection cuffs to actuate movement or stabilise joints. To avoid excessive mechanical loading, the interface with the wearer's body needs to be carefully designed. The purpose of this study was to establish the magnitude of circumferential compression at the lower limb during walking that causes discomfort/pain. It was hypothesized that the thresholds differ from those during standing. A cohort of 21 healthy participants were tested using two sizes of pneumatic cuffs, inflated at the thigh and calf in a tonic or phasic manner. The results showed lower inflation pressures triggering discomfort/pain at the thigh, with tonic compression, and wider pneumatic cuffs. The thresholds were lower during walking than standing still. Deep tissue oxygenation increased during phasic compression and decreased during tonic compression. According to the findings, circumferential compression by soft exoskeletons is preferably applied at anatomical sites with smaller volumes of soft tissue, using narrow connection cuffs and inflation pressures below 14 kPa.",

Furthermore, the results obtained by human subject tests were compared to results of an anthropodynamic dummy test. Experiments were conducted on a vertically actuated platform under laboratory conditions with 16 human subjects and an anthropodynamic dummy. Seat Effective Amplitude Transmissibility of the seat pan and the seat backrest were calculated to evaluate ride quality. Seat transmissibility ranged between 73.6% for backrest and 177.7% for pan. Based on the results of statistical tests, the hypothesis that the transmissibility of a seat would be influenced by seat cushion conditions was accepted (p < 0.05). It was also shown that an anthropodynamic dummy test could replace tests with human subjects (r2 = 0.907) if the target population was matched sufficiently.",

    "abstract": "Research suggests an association between motor variability (MV) during repetitive work and work-related musculoskeletal disorders (MSDs). However, whether MV is a consistent individual trait, even across working conditions or tasks, remains unknown. This study assessed whether individual MV traits were consistent during complex work performed under different temporal conditions. Fifteen women performed cyclic assembly under four conditions differing in pace and organisation (line-type, batch-type). MV of trapezius muscle activity and upper arm elevation was quantified and partitioned into variance components. For all MV metrics, a non-zero between-subjects variance was found, indicating consistent individual MV traits across conditions. Variance between subjects was higher for electromyography (EMG) MV metrics compared with kinematic metrics. Our results showed individuals exhibited consistent MV traits across working conditions differing in pace and production process. Further research is needed to understand whether MV is an individual predictive factor for MSD onset or progression.",

    "abstract": "Research suggests an association between motor variability (MV) during repetitive work and work-related musculoskeletal disorders (MSDs). However, whether MV is a consistent individual trait, even across working conditions or tasks, remains unknown. This study assessed whether individual MV traits were consistent during complex work performed under different temporal conditions. Fifteen women performed cyclic assembly under four conditions differing in pace and organisation (line-type, batch-type). MV of trapezius muscle activity and upper arm elevation was quantified and partitioned into variance components. For all MV metrics, a non-zero between-subjects variance was found, indicating consistent individual MV traits across conditions. Variance between subjects was higher for electromyography (EMG) MV metrics compared with kinematic metrics. Our results showed individuals exhibited consistent MV traits across working conditions differing in pace and production process. Further research is needed to understand whether MV is an individual predictive factor for MSD onset or progression.",

    "abstract": "Informal caregivers are an integral part of care delivery for persons with dementia (PwD). Informal caregivers take part in a wide range of care activities both individually and collaboratively with other caregivers. Caregiving often involves high demands in the face of limited resources, which can lead to stress, burden, and burnout. To support caregivers, we need to conceptualize caregiving activities they perform, and the networks and roles through which they perform work. We performed a directed content analysis on interview data from twenty caregivers and applied a human factors approach to characterize informal caregiving work. Our results revealed 1) nuances in caregiving roles, 2) differences in caregiving networks, and 3) 13 categories of caregiving activities characterized by time commitments; physical, cognitive and socio-behavioral demands; and varying network dependencies. These findings can be applied in future studies to evaluate the needs of caregiving networks and how to better support them.",

    "abstract": "From an ergonomics perspective, the environmental characteristics should facilitate user activities. Matching user capabilities to demands of the environment is essential. However, about some users such as those with visual impairments, there is little information available for use in designing products and spaces. There is also a gap in information regarding the commutes and needs of the visually impaired, making it even more difficult to establish how environments should be designed to include this population.This study aimed to identify the information needs of people with visual impairment in terms of: 1) Daily life activities, 2) Wayfinding in the complex built environments, 3) Use of the signals provided by the environment 4) Characteristics of the environment which reduce the usability of a space and may put the user in danger, and 5) Safety perception. Data were obtained through a semi-structured interview to which eighteen adults responded. All had either complete blindness or severe visual impairment. For orientation, the most common references were texture or changes in ground level/surface, along with such ambient elements as noise or smells. Information presented in Braille was reported as little used, due to difficulty in finding such information. Regarding safety, participants reported feeling unsafe; most mentioned crossing the street as a major risk. Using auditory, tactile or even olfactory signals may provide important information while commuting: thus, designing signals which consider and highlight these senses is paramount. Assessing features and location of existing tactile signals is also required, to identify opportunities for improving the safety and independence of people with visual impairment.",

    "abstract": "Semi-autonomous cars are already on the road and highly autonomous cars will soon be with us. Little is understood about how drivers will adapt to the changing relationship with their vehicle, but to ensure safety and consumer acceptance, this insight is vital. To this end, an on-road study in a semi-autonomous vehicle was undertaken with six UK drivers. The ‘think aloud’ technique was employed and video and audio footage of their interaction with the vehicle was captured. Neisser's (1976) Perceptual Cycle Model (PCM) was used to analyse the data and three case studies are presented to highlight how poor synergy between driver and semi-autonomous vehicles can occur from the lens of Schema, Action or World information. Seven key design considerations are proposed to ensure a more positive and safer interaction between driver and autonomous vehicle to guide focus by manufacturers. Further evidence for the existence of a ‘counter cycle’ (Plant and Stanton, 2015) within the PCM is found and how this relates to the challenges of using verbal protocals expressed during a fast moving dynamic task is discussed.",

This review aims to synthesize and examine the role of clothing on participation of persons with a physical disability. Six research databases and grey literature were searched following Arksey & O'Malley's six steps, including multiple expert consultations. English and French articles contributing to how clothing affects participation were included and tabulated based on the International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health. Fifty-seven articles and 88 websites were included. A variety of stakeholder perspectives, diagnoses, and types of clothing were represented. Clothing mostly influences mobility and self-care, as well as various personal factors. Forty-nine percent of articles reported essential clothing design features to consider. Clothing is an important and complex environmental factor that interacts with all health domains, including participation. Future research should consider intersectoral initiatives.",

    "abstract": "Truck platoon driving is a current branch of automated driving, which has the potential to radically change the work routine of professional drivers. In a platoon system, one truck (semi-)automatically follows a lead truck with a reduced distance, which produces significant savings in fuel and enables better traffic flow. In a current application of truck platoon driving, the following vehicle operates at level-2 automation. Thus, the driver of the following truck merely has to supervise the semi-automated system, which takes over steering and speed control when engaged. Level-2 truck platoon driving had not been tested with professional drivers in real traffic before. We hypothesized that user acceptance would improve after the experience of platoon driving. Quantitative questionnaires and qualitative interviews were conducted with 10 drivers before and after an extensive Autobahn experience. The results show a clear increase of acceptance after the experience. Platoon driving was evaluated to be more useful, easier to use, and safer after the experience. Besides perceived driving safety, the prestige of truck platooning, the perceived usefulness of the system, and general technology affinity co-determined user acceptance.",

Systems can be implemented to improve passengers’ experiences, but these may also affect the experiences of crew working on board trains. This first-of-a-kind research extends the concept of customer journey mapping as a design tool to understand the experiences of train crew. To produce these crew journey maps, interviews and user observation methods were adopted (N = 22). Results show that two main negative touchpoints for the crew occur at the platform-train interface and during revenue protection activities. This paper presents an innovative methodological contribution around journey mapping to better understand rail experiences, but revolving around the crew rather than the expected consumer experience. We conclude this paper proposing requirements for technological systems and indicate opportunities for the design of systems to generate human-centred improvements for the working practices and experiences of train crew.",

    "year": "2020",
    "doi": "10.1016/j.apergo.2020.103060",
    "abstract": "Introduction The period following discharge can present risks for older adults. Most research has focused on hospital discharge with less attention paid to on-going care needs. Despite evidence that patients undertake ‘invisible work’ to improve care safety, their reported willingness to be involved in care, and the consensus that successful transitions interventions include patient involvement, in reality, this is variable. Further, little research has viewed transitional care as a ‘system’, with gaps, interdependencies and variability across settings, nor the role of patients and families in supporting the system resilience. Research objectives 1) model transitional care from multiple perspectives using the Functional Resonance Analysis Method (FRAM); 2) use the model to develop a theory of change to support intervention development. Method We drew data from two studies: i) exploring the perspective of older adults across transitional care, and ii) exploring how health services experience transitional care. We employed the FRAM to develop a model of transitional care, with a system boundary spanning an older patient's admission to hospital, through to thirty days post-discharge. Findings Modelling transitional care from multiple perspectives was challenging. 27 functions were identified with interdependencies between hospital-based functions and patient-led functions once home, the success of which may impact on transitions ‘outcomes’ (e.g. safety events, readmissions). The model supported development of a theory of change, to guide future intervention development. Conclusions Supporting certain patient-facing upstream hospital functions (e.g. encouraging mobility, supporting a better understanding of medication and condition), may lead to improved outcomes for patients following hospital discharge.",

    "doi": "10.1016/j.apergo.2020.103076",
    "abstract": "The PC-based driver training programme, Risk Awareness and Perception Training (RAPT) has been successful in improving young drivers' hazard anticipation and mitigation responses in both simulator and on-road studies. The current research aimed to evaluate the success of an adaptation of this training for the UK context, along with investigating the impact of the presentation modality on RAPT effectiveness. Traditionally RAPT has been delivered on a PC monitor, which does not allow the same range of head and eye movements that drivers use when on the road. Thus, it was anticipated that the 360° field-of-view provided by Head Mounted Display (HMD) technology would provide a more ecologically valid experience, facilitating deeper processing and encoding of driving relevant scanning patterns, and an increased capacity to identify potentially hazardous areas of a driving scenario. Using a between-subjects design, three different training modalities were compared - a PC-based version using still images (PC-Stills), a HMD version using still images (HMD-Stills), and a HMD version using videos (HMD-video). All three training groups’ performance on the UK Hazard Perception test was compared to that of a control group, who received no training. Results indicated that the adaptation of the training materials for the UK context was successful, with all three training programmes leading to performance improvements in the RAPT tests. Although participants in the HMD-video condition required more attempts to pass the training, this group showed the greatest improvement in hazard perception scores from the pre- to the post-training tests. Results also showed scenario-based differences between the modalities, suggesting that the success of different versions of RAPT may be linked to the type of risky scenario being targeted.",

    "abstract": "Physiological indicators, including eye tracking measures, may provide insight into human decision making and cognition in many domains, including weather forecasting. Situation awareness (SA), a critical component of forecast decision making, is commonly conceptualized as the degree to which information is perceived, understood, and projected into a future context. Drawing upon recent applications of eye tracking in the study of forecaster decision making, we investigate the relationship among eye movement measures, automation, and SA assessed through a freeze probe assessment method. In addition, we explore the relationship between an automated forecasting decision aid use and information seeking behavior. In this study, a sample of professional weather forecasters completed a series of tasks, informed by a set of forecasting decision aids, and with variable access to an experimental automated tool, while an eye tracking system captured data related to eye movements and information usage. At the end of each forecasting task, participants responded to a set of questions related to the environmental situation in the framework of a survey-based assessment technique in order to assess their level of situation awareness. Regression analysis revealed a moderate relationship between the SA measure and eye tracking metrics, supporting the hypothesis that eye tracking may have utility in assessing SA. The results support the use of eye tracking in the assessment of specific and measurable attributes of the decision-making process in weather forecasting. The findings are discussed in light of potential benefits that eye tracking could bring to human performance assessment as well as decision-making research in the forecasting domain.",

    "abstract": "The aim of this study was to employ validated biological markers to quantify the physiologic consequences of exposure to whole-body vibration (WBV) and evaluate the relative impact of mining vehicle operator vibration exposure on physiological responses as compared to vertical-axial dominant WBV. In a laboratory-based study with a repeated-measures design, we played actual field-measured floor vibration profiles into a 6-degree-of-freedom motion platform to create different realistic WBV exposures: 1) vertical-dominant vibration collected from long-haul trucks, 2) multi-axial vibration collected from mining heavy equipment vehicles, and 3) no vibration (control condition). Circulating biomarkers of interest were cortisol and catecholamines (epinephrine and norepinephrine) to assess physiological stress, interleukin-6 (IL-6) and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNFα) to test for inflammation, thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS) to measure oxidative stress, and myoglobin and plasma creatine kinase to assess muscle damage. We collected blood samples at pre-exposure (0 h), during-exposure (2 and 4 h), and 2 h into recovery after the WBV exposure (6 h) in all four exposure conditions. The results showed that a single, 4-h acute exposure to WBV may not be sufficient to induce skeletal muscle damage, inflammation or physiologic stress measurable in the blood. No significant differences were observed between conditions for any of the biomarkers that could be attributed to the exposure contrast between vertical-dominant and multi-axial WBV exposures. These findings further indicate known complications of WBV exposure likely arise secondary to chronic, repeated exposures that give rise to subclinical stresses that were not captured here.",

    "abstract": "The current research proposed and tested a structural equation model (SEM) that describes hypothesized relationships among factors affecting trust in human-robot interaction (HRI) such as trustworthiness, human-likeness, intelligence, perfect automation schema (PAS), and affect. A video stimulus depicting an autonomous guard robot interacting with humans was employed as a stimulus via Amazon's Mechanical Turk to recruit 233 participants. Human-related and robot-related metrics were found to affect trustworthiness that subsequently affected trust. In particular, ability (as a trustworthiness facet) was a dominant factor affecting trust in HRI. Integrity was found to mediate the relationships between robot- and human-related metrics and trustworthiness. This study also showed a correlation between intelligence and trustworthiness, as well as between PAS and trustworthiness. The findings of the present study have significant implications for both theory and practice on factors and levels that affect trust in HRI.",

    "abstract": "The present study investigated effects of cognitive and visual loads on driving performance after take-over request (TOR) in an automated driving task. Participants completed automated driving in a driving simulator without a non-driving related task, with an easy non-driving related task, and with a difficult non-driving related task. The primary task was to monitor the environment and the system state. An N-back task and a Surrogate Reference Task (SuRT) were adapted to induce cognitive and visual loads respectively. The system followed a front vehicle automatically. Driving performance was measured by responses to a critical event (appearance of a broken-down car) after the automated system issued TOR and then terminated. High subjective difficulty of the N-back task was related to increased time and increased steering angle variance in the time course from onset of steering control to lane change, while high subjective difficulty of SuRT was related to increased steering angle variance in the time course after lane change. This suggests that both cognitive and visual loads affect driving performance after TOR in automated driving, but the effects appear in different time courses.",

    "abstract": "This study proposed to investigate the thermal properties and subjective thermal discomfort of five virtual reality headsets, and their relationships. Twenty-seven university students used each of the five headsets for 45 min. Microclimate temperature and relative humidity were measured by miniature dataloggers. Infrared thermography was used to measure temperature distribution on the contact points between user's face and the headsets. Participants reported subjective thermal discomfort associated with using each headset. The average microclimate temperature and relative humidity increased by 7.8 °C and 3.5% respectively after headset use. Overall subjective thermal discomfort increased along with duration of use and came primarily from the display. Applying the linear mixed-effects model showed that subjective thermal discomfort is positively correlated with duration of use, microclimate temperature, relative humidity and display coverage area. Conversely, thermal discomfort is negatively correlated with total coverage area, with microclimate temperature acting as the most significant contributing factor. The headsets were ranked by pairing the objective measurements with subjective evaluations.",

    "doi": "10.1016/j.apergo.2020.103073",
    "abstract": "The debate around skeuomorphic and flat designs has been long lasting and inconclusive, in part because of the lack of empirical evidence supporting the superiority of one or the other icon style from the perspectives of function and aesthetics. Therefore, this study investigated whether older and younger users perceive the aesthetics of icon styles in the same manner as designers and which style results in the most efficient visual search. Using an experimental system that we developed, 24 older and 24 younger participants rated and searched application icons belonging to the two styles. The results indicated that there was generally a notable difference between participants' and designers' perceptions of icon design styles, even after training, and that the perceived icon design styles further influenced the visual search time and accuracy of the participants as well as their evaluation of the icons’ beauty. The results imply that the younger participants could use the skeuomorphic icons more efficiently than they could use the flat icons and that they had an advantage over older participants in terms of this ability; however, aesthetically they appreciated flat icons more. In contrast, older participants searched skeuomorphic icons more quickly and accurately than they did flat icons, and aesthetically they appreciated skeuomorphic icons more.",

    "abstract": "Hospital-based care of pediatric trauma patients includes transitions between units that are critical for quality of care and patient safety. Using a macroergonomics approach, we identify work system barriers and facilitators in care transitions. We interviewed eighteen healthcare professionals involved in transitions from emergency department (ED) to operating room (OR), OR to pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) and ED to PICU. We applied the Systems Engineering Initiative for Patient Safety (SEIPS) process modeling method and identified nine dimensions of barriers and facilitators – anticipation, ED decision making, interacting with family, physical environment, role ambiguity, staffing/resources, team cognition, technology and characteristic of trauma care. For example, handoffs involving all healthcare professionals in the OR to PICU transition created a shared understanding of the patient, but sometimes included distractions. Understanding barriers and facilitators can guide future improvements, e.g., designing a team display to support team cognition of healthcare professionals in the care transitions.",

We investigated whether auditory cues could increase anticipation and subsequently reduce motion sickness. Participants (N = 20) were exposed on a sled on a rail track to two 15-min conditions. Both were identical in terms of motion, being composed of the same repeated 9 m fore-aft displacements, with a semi-random timing of pauses and direction. The auditory cues were either 1) informative on the timing and direction of the upcoming motion, or 2) non-informative. Illness ratings were recorded at 1-min intervals using a 11-point scale. After exposure, average illness ratings were significantly lower for the condition that contained informative auditory cues, as compared to the condition without informative cues. This knowledge, i.e. that auditory signals can improve anticipation to motion, could be of importance in reducing carsickness in domains such as that of autonomous vehicles.",

Shoulder pain was positively associated with biomechanical exposure in both samples, and with perceived stress only in the pharmaceutical preparation manufacturer, while factors related to work organization and psychosocial factors had indirect impacts on the risk of chronic shoulder pain in both samples. The results provide a deeper understanding of the complex relationships between workplace risk factors and shoulder pain.",

This is important because SSDs that use auditory displays could involve binaural presentation requiring both ear canals, or monaural presentation requiring only one – but which ear would be ideal? SSDs may be similar to reading, as an image (printed word) is converted into sound (when read aloud). Reading, and language more generally, are typically lateralised to the left cerebral hemisphere. Yet, unlike symbolic written language, SSDs convert images to sound based on visuospatial properties, with the right cerebral hemisphere potentially having a role in processing such visuospatial data. Here we investigated whether there is a hemispheric bias in the processing of visual-to-auditory sensory substitution information and whether that varies as a function of experience and visual ability. We assessed the lateralization of auditory processing with two tests: a standard dichotic listening test and a novel dichotic listening test created using the auditory information produced by an SSD, The vOICe. Participants were tested either in the lab or online with the same stimuli. We did not find a hemispheric bias in the processing of visual-to-auditory information in visually impaired, experienced vOICe users. Further, we did not find any difference between visually impaired, experienced vOICe users and sighted novices in the hemispheric lateralization of visual-to-auditory information processing. Although standard dichotic listening is lateralised to the left hemisphere, the auditory processing of images in SSDs is bilateral, possibly due to the increased influence of right hemisphere processing. Auditory SSDs might therefore be equally effective with presentation to either ear if a monaural, rather than binaural, presentation were necessary.",

    "doi": "10.1016/j.apergo.2020.103078",
    "abstract": "Thermal comfort modeling has been of interest in built environment research for decades. Mostly the modeling approaches focused on an average response of a large group of building occupants. Recently, the focus has been shifted towards personal comfort models that predict individuals' thermal comfort responses. Currently, thermal comfort responses are collected from the occupants via survey. This study explored if the thermal comfort of individuals could be predicted using machine learning algorithms while relaying on the set of collected inputs from an experiment. The model was developed using experimental data including collected from a previously performed experiment in the climate chamber. Two different approaches based on the output data (thermal sensation and thermal comfort votes) and five different sets of input variables were explored. The algorithms tested were Support Vector Machine with four different Kernel functions (Linear, Quadratic, Cubic and Gaussian) and Ensemble Algorithms (Boosted trees, Bagged trees and RUSBoosted trees). The combination of occupants' heating behavior with a personal comfort system (PCS), skin temperatures, time and environmental data were used for the development of personal comfort models to predict individuals' thermal preference. The study investigated the novel combination of inputs such as the use of skin temperature and settings of the personalized heating system as parameters in predicting personal thermal comfort. The results showed that personal comfort models among all tested approaches and subjects showed the best median accuracy of 0.84 using RUSBoosted trees. Individually looking, the approach using thermal sensation output produced better prediction accuracy. On the other hand, the models based on inputs that consisted of PCS control behavior and mean and hand skin temperatures produced the best prediction accuracy when assessing all tested algorithms. The main limitation of the study is the number of test subjects, and further recommendation is to perform more experiments.",

    "abstract": "Many studies of ballpoint pens have been conducted. However, those studies have not considered the emotional factors that can enhance user experience. Styluses resemble ballpoint pens in many ways, which are widely available in a variety of styles. Therefore, in the present study, we explored the physical and emotional attributes that improve user satisfaction with typical ballpoint pens, with the goal of also understanding what factors might be important for stylus design. First, 14 emotional factors associated with the pens were derived. Second, 16 different types of ball-point pens were measured for six physical properties. Then, an experiment was performed to assess user satisfaction and emotional factors for pens. The House of Quality (HOQ) was used to obtain the chief physical properties. Results showed that to increase user satisfaction it is necessary to make pens be comfortable, fine, refined, deep, and natural. Also, we found that for high user satisfaction pens need to be heavier and longer, have thick and antislip grips and thin nibs, and their center of gravity should be located close to the nib to increase user satisfaction.",

    "abstract": "The prevalence of musculoskeletal (MSK) symptoms in radiographers is high, similar to other healthcare occupations that involve high levels of physical exertion (e.g. patient handling; grasping and moving equipment). Reports of interventions to reduce MSK discomfort in radiographers are limited. A participatory approach was used to investigate daily challenges, needs, and opportunities for developing interventions to address exposures to many of the risk factors that contribute to MSK symptoms in radiographers. In this paper, we present the expressed needs of experienced radiographers (including assistance with patient handling, security, supportive design of equipment and work spaces), along with their evaluations of several intervention concepts intended to address some of those needs. We also report results from tests of three prototype interventions stemming from this participatory process that demonstrate the potential for new engineering control concepts to reduce the physical effort associated with some of the most common tasks radiographers perform.",

    "abstract": "The purpose of this study was to develop a new pipette design in which the pipette is operated by four fingers, taking into account the anatomy and anthropometry of the hand. The proposed new pipette designs were compared with a traditional thumb-push pipette based on muscle activity, wrist posture, subjective discomfort ratings for upper extremities, and user preference. The results of the study revealed that the four-finger, ergonomic pipette design reduced muscle exertion (25% reduction for aspiration and 35% reduction for dispensing), awkward wrist posture (33% reduction in wrist flexion, radial and ulnar deviation), and perceived discomfort in the wrist, hand and lower arm. Furthermore, most participants (9 of 10) who used a pipette in their daily work preferred the new pipette designs to a traditional thumb-push pipette design. Thus, we expect that this study will contribute to the reduction of WMSDs risk factors and pain.",

The work presented here identified the ranges of “comfortable” splay in different styles of seats and related changes in seating pressure due to leg splay. Sixteen midsized male participants were tested in six seats: a flat control, three mid-sized sedan, a sports car, and a pickup truck. Participants sat with two leg conditions: 1) shoulder width apart and 2) rotating their legs to splay to a self-identified, comfortable position. For each test, the participant placed his left leg on a foot support and right leg on a depressible pedal to mimic a driving position. In each posture, leg angle and seat pan pressures were collected. Of the seats tested, the flat wooden seat had the highest possible splay (24.5°). The three sedan seats had similar splay angles (16.1–18.5°). The lowest splay values were in the sports car seat (8.96°) and truck seat (7.46°). This reduction in splay was attributed to the more aggressive bolsters in the sports car and a higher seat design position in the pickup truck seat. Following participant splay the pressures in the seat bolsters increased while the pressure in the left thigh and left buttocks regions decreased. By determining the comfortable ranges of splay and how pressure distribution is affected, seat designers and automobile manufacturers can use these data when evaluating seat designs and occupant positioning.",

    "abstract": "This study investigated the ergonomics of three simulated 120 m vertical ladder ascents and differences between novice (NC) and experienced climbers (EC). Seven EC and 10 NC undertook three 120 m climbs; comprising of four 30 m climbs. Ascending 120 m was reported as a high physical demand, supported by high peak HRs (~173 b.min−1 across the three climbs) and V ˙ O2 (~3.1 L.min−1 across the three climbs). Grip strength and endurance were significantly (p < 0.05) impaired by ascents. With multiple ascents, toe clearance was reduced (Climb 1 – 0.0515 m; Climb 3 – 0.046 m), and participants reached higher with their arms (shoulder angle: Climb 1 – 117°; Climb 3 – 136°). NC demonstrated less range of movement through the hips (NC – 46°; EC – 58°), and higher muscle activation in the upper body (NC – 60%; EC – 49%). Experience reduced cumulative climbing times (exercise + rest), whilst maintaining the same physiological demand as NC and maintained optimised movement patterns for longer.",

A representative sample of 1691 adolescents in Singapore (51% girls; 10–19 years) completed an online questionnaire at baseline and one-year follow-up. After adjusting for potential confounders, prospective associations were found between baseline smartphone use and follow-up neck/shoulder (OR = 1.61(95%CI = 1.06–2.44)) and low back (OR = 1.86(1.10–3.14)) symptoms; tablet use was also associated with neck/shoulder, low back and arms symptoms (OR = 1.33(1.04–1.71)to1.52(1.18–1.95)). No associations were observed between the duration of smartphone/tablet use and symptoms. Baseline patterns of use (bout length, certain types of activities, multitasking) were associated with follow-up musculoskeletal symptoms. Smartphone/tablet use was not related to visual outcomes (visual symptoms, wearing glasses/contact lenses, myopia) at follow-up. These findings suggest that patterns of smartphone/tablet use (though not the duration of use) can pose a prospective risk for musculoskeletal symptoms.",

    "abstract": "The aim was to investigate if the method of normalizing surface electromyography (sEMG) can change results on sex differences in the muscular activation of the shoulder girdle muscles during a simulated work task. sEMG was recorded in 36 asymptomatic participants (17 females, 19 males) from four parts of trapezius and from serratus anterior muscles during a simulated work task. Four normalization methods, one involving maximal voluntary contractions (MVCs) and three involving submaximal voluntary contractions were applied. Sex differences in absolute and normalized amplitude of sEMG were analyzed. The normalization method had a significant influence on the observed sex differences. Females only showed higher sEMG amplitude than males when the sEMGs were normalized to MVC and to a submaximal contraction based on 20% of MVC for the upper trapezius (acromial fibers). Researchers and practitioners should be aware of the impact of the sEMG normalization method in sex differences investigation.",

    "abstract": "The purpose of this study was to assess postural stability in the medial-lateral (ML) direction when carrying unilateral and bilateral loads during stair negotiation. Twenty-four healthy young adults were instructed to ascend and descend a three step staircase under three load conditions: no load, 20% body mass (BM) bilateral load, and 20% BM unilateral load. A modified time-to-contact (TTC) method was proposed to evaluate postural stability during stair negotiation. Carrying unilateral loads required more rapid postural adjustments as evidenced by lower minimum ML TTC and ML TTC percentage as compared bilateral loads and no load during stair descent. In addition, lower ML TTC and TTC percentage were found for loaded limb stance for stair descent. Taken together, unilateral loads and the loaded leg during stair descent are of concern when considering postural stability during load carriage. These results illustrate differing postural control challenges for stair ascent and descent during load carriage.",

    "abstract": "Pushing and pulling wheeled objects represent a significant part of manual material handling activities in industry. Medical investigations and epidemiological studies proved the correlation between such activities and the occurrence of lumbago, low back pain and adverse effects on the shoulders. The ISO 11228–2:2007 provides the recommended limits for pushing and pulling. Such values are the results of psychophysical studies realized under prescribed speed conditions referring to a slow walk. However, observation of real industrial and service sector environments reveals that workers are required to perform pushing activities at higher speed of motion. The aim of this study was to investigate the impact of the variation in the speed of motion and load conditions on push forces. 96 subjects performed a total of 2592 trials consisting of pushing an industrial trolley for warehouse applications, at different speed values and load conditions. Results confirm the presence of correlation between the increasing speed of motion and push forces. The findings have practical value for researchers, occupational physicians and ergonomics practitioners.",

This study developed and tested a novel syringe adapter designed to reduce muscle strain associated with repetitive fluid draws. Three syringe plunger extension methods (ring-finger, middle-finger, and syringe adapter) were studied across twenty participants. Electromyogram signals for the flexor digitorum superficialis and extensor digitorum muscles were recorded. The syringe adapter required 31% of the 90th percentile flexor muscle activity as compared to the ring-finger syringe extension method, and 45% the 90th percentile flexor muscle activity as compared to the middle-finger method (p < 0.001). The greatest differences were observed when the syringe was near full extension. Although the syringe adapter took more time than the other syringe extension methods (1.5 times greater), it greatly helped reduce physical stress associated with repetitive, awkward syringe procedures.",

    "abstract": "There are about 44 million licensed older drivers in the U.S. Older adults have higher crash rates and fatalities as compared to middle-aged and young drivers, which might be associated with degradations in sensory, cognitive, and physical capabilities. Advanced driver-assistance systems (ADAS) have the potential to substantially improve safety by removing some of driver vehicle control responsibilities. However, a critical aspect of providing ADAS is educating drivers on their operational characteristics and continued use. Twenty older adults participated in a driving simulation study assessing the effectiveness of video-based and demonstration-based training protocols in learning ADAS considering gender differences. The findings revealed video-based training to be more effective than demonstration-based training in improving driver performance and reducing off-road visual attention allocation and mental workload. In addition, female drivers required lower investment of mental effort (higher neural efficiency) to maintain the performance relative to males and they were less distracted by ADAS. However, male drivers were faster in activating ADAS as compared to females since they were monitoring the status of ADAS features more frequently while driving. The findings of this study provided an empirical support for using video-based approach for learning ADAS in older adults to improve driver safety and supported previous findings on older adults’ learning that as age increases there is a tendency to prefer more passive and observational learning methods.",

    "abstract": "Within the Police service of England and Wales the wearing of ballistic and stab resistant body armour is common, with most police forces mandating its usage when away from the police station. Of all the serving police officers in England and Wales 29.1% are female (Hargreaves et al., 2017). A survey was developed and then distributed by the Police Federation of England and Wales to all servicing police officers up to the rank of Inspector. The survey returned 2633 responses after cleaning of the data. From the responses it was seen that the predominant bra type worn is underwired (71%) and the predominant UK bra size is 34B (9%). It was also determined that the predominant areas where the body armour either rubbed or caused discomfort were the left and right anterior mammary regions and the posterior lateral sacral region. By understanding the distribution of bra size, type of bra worn and areas of discomfort or rubbing it helps further understand the issues faced by female police officers and how body armour design could be improved.",

    "abstract": "The objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of different target locations on musculoskeletal loading and task performance during virtual reality (VR) interactions. A repeated-measures laboratory study with 20 participants (24.2 ± 1.5 years; 10 males) was conducted to compare biomechanical exposures (joint angle, moment, and muscle activity in the neck and shoulder), subjective discomfort, and task performance (speed and accuracy) during two VR tasks (omni-directional pointing and painting tasks) among different vertical target locations (ranged from 15° above to 30° below eye height). The results showed that neck flexion/extension angle and moment, shoulder flexion angle and moment, shoulder abduction angle, muscle activities of neck and shoulder muscles, and subjective discomfort in the neck and shoulder significantly varied by target locations (p's < 0.001). The target locations at 15° above and 30° below eye height demonstrated greater shoulder flexion (up to 52°), neck flexion moment (up to 2.7Nm), anterior deltoid muscle activity, and subjective discomfort in the neck and shoulder as compared to the other locations. This result indicates that excessive vertical target locations should be avoided to reduce musculoskeletal discomfort and injury risks during VR interactions. Based on relatively lower biomechanical exposures and trade-off between neck and shoulder postures, vertical target location between eye height and 15° below eye height could be recommended for VR use.",

    "abstract": "Occupant discomfort, induced by vibration transmitted through a vehicle seat, can be evaluated by measuring vibration on the contact interface between the occupant and seat. In the previous study (Ittianuwat et al., 2016), measuring five contact points of the back-backrest, including centre point (ISO 2631-1), was considered as an important factor for assessing occupant comfort in frequencies where seat structure resonances occur. To enhance occupant vibration comfort in the early seat design stage, predicting the dynamic response of the coupled human-seat system on various contact locations is necessary. In this study, a low order seated human body Finite Element (FE) model was developed for predicting vibration transmissibility of the human-seat system in frequencies up to 30 Hz. Throughout the optimization process, the parameters of the model were obtained by comparing measured transmissibilities of the occupied vehicle seat system. The human-seat system vibration modes were also compared and verified with measured data by calculating MAC (Modal Assurance Criterion). The results showed that two human body vibration modes coupled with foam were observed below 10 Hz, and two coupled human and seat structure fore-aft modes were observed at around 20.1 Hz and 21.9 Hz. Fore-aft transmissibility of the model at various locations of contact provided reasonable correlation with the measured data. The developed low order human model enables the prediction of the fore-aft transmissibility on various back-backrest contact locations up to 30 Hz. This showed the capability of improving occupant's vibration comfort by predicting transmissibilities of the human-seat system in the early stage of developing a new vehicle seat.",

    "abstract": "The objective of this study was to investigate biomechanical loads on the lumbar spine as a function of working in a confined vertical space, consistent with baggage handling inside the baggage compartment of an airplane. Ten male subjects performed baggage handling tasks using confined (kneeling, sitting) and unconfined (stooping) lifting styles. Dependent measures of torso flexion and three-dimensional spinal loads were assessed with an electromyography-driven biomechanical model. Lifting exertions typical to airline baggage handling posed significant risk to the lumbar spine, regardless of lifting style. Statistically significant differences attributable to lift style (stooping, kneeling, sitting) were not observed for peak compressive, lateral shear, or resultant spinal loads, but lifting while kneeling decreased anterior/posterior (A/P) shear spinal loads relative to stooping (p = 0.02). Collectively, kneeling offers the greatest benefit when lifting in confined spaces because of the ability to keep the torso upright, subsequently reducing shear forces on the lumbar spine.",

    "abstract": "Musculoskeletal sitting discomfort, specifically caused by long-term sitting, is primarily triggered by physiological fatigue on the human body due to its own weight. Passive seat designs can produce inadequate surface pressure zones on the body resulting in high musculoskeletal stress leading to physical discomfort. However, as proposed in this work, this can be alleviated by decentralizing the occupant's weight with an automatic morphing lumbar seat design. The morphing seat design presented in this paper adjusts in real-time, the seat's surface curvature to decentralize the pressure distribution. The seat system consists of a custom-made pressure sensor mat embedded within the backrest cushion and two pneumatic actuators located in the lumbar area. The purpose of this seat design is to produce a change in the backrest surface curvature so that such change creates a pressure distribution closely resembling a reference distribution. Said reference distribution is derived in this work based on the concept of the Ideal Pressure Distribution. The effectiveness of the discomfort reduction due to the decentralization of the backrest load is evaluated using an objective discomfort metric known as Seat Pan Distribution percentage applied only to the backrest, peak pressure areas and contact area. Preliminary performance tests of the seat system demonstrate the successful decentralization of the passenger's pressure distribution. The evaluation of the discomfort reduction is observed via the lowering in the objective discomfort metric and peak pressure areas while simultaneously increasing the contact area between the passenger and seat.",

This study examined the effects of rPPE on the development of fatigue of the erector spinae and trapezius muscles. Surface electromyography (EMG) was used to capture muscle activity, and both time domain (average rectified value) and frequency domain (median frequency) measures were considered in the assessment of localized muscle fatigue. Sixteen participants performed a simulated surgical procedure requiring intermittent 30° flexed static trunk posture with and without rPPE on separate days. The results showed that the rPPE condition demonstrated significantly greater (p < 0.05) downward shift in median frequency in the left lumbar erector spinae and left lower thoracic erector spinae consistent with task-induced localized muscle fatigue. Ergonomic intervention strategies are discussed.",

    "abstract": "Everyday driving is a significant source of greenhouse gases and pollutants within developed nations. Finding ways to combat these emissions and minimise the impact of anthropometric climate change is a growing challenge for all research disciplines. This current paper explores the use of a design toolkit “Design with Intent” to generate ideas for in-vehicle interfaces designed to reduce fuel use and emissions. A preliminary interface validation assessment is also presented in order to assess whether the ideas generated were appropriate in encouraging behavioural change and of potential value. It is suggested that whilst further evaluation of the interfaces are required, the use of the “Design with Intent” toolkit facilitated the creative process, allowing engineers to conceive initial interface designs in a creative manner.",

    "abstract": "Many workplace falls occur during tasks involving carrying a load with both hands. Successful balance and gait during bimanual load carrying may be attributed to the adaptability of a system to navigate changing environments (e.g. construction site). This study investigates how bimanual load carrying affects adaptability of balance and gait, using 0%, 5%, and 10% of body mass in 14 young adults. Regularity of balance, and measures of range and center of pressure distance, and gait measures of stride length and step width were quantified using sample entropy. When carrying 5% load, anterior-posterior balance became less adaptable relative to 0%. As load increased from 0% to 5%–10%, step width narrowed and variability increased significantly, indicating possible increased fall risk while walking. Healthy, young adults may be at an increased risk of falls when carrying a load due to a loss in adaptability in a dynamic workplace environment.",

An initial incremental exercise test (VO2max 52.2 ± 4.7 ml kg−1.min−1) was conducted, followed by four tests of 20 min duration (running speed 9.8 ± 1.1 km/h) with loads carried of 0, 1 kg, 3 kg, and 6 kg with the two backpack designs in a randomized order. Economy was assessed by energy cost of running (CR), oxygen cost (O2 cost), heart rate (HR) and rate of perceived exertion (RPE). Repeated measure ANOVA revealed a non-significant main effect for CR, O2 cost, HR, RPE between systems. Post-hoc comparison of significant time × position interaction showed for CR, F(3,33) = 5.34, p < .01, ηp 2 = 0.33, and O2 cost, F(3,33) = 5.15, p < .01, ηp 2 = 0.32, that carrying weight in the back/front were significantly lower after 20 min (CR: p = .02 and O2 cost: p = .03).

    "abstract": "Human movement control requires attention to accurately tune motor commands in response to environmental changes. Dual task paradigms are used to test the role of attention on motor performance. Usually the tasks used have little resemblance with every day experience. Here we ask: Does a common cognitive task, such as a mobile phone conversation, compromise motor performance on stairs? Eight young participants negotiated an instrumented seven-step staircase. Stair negotiation while talking on a mobile phone was compared to normal stair negotiation. Stepping parameters, jerk cost (measure of smoothness of locomotion) and step clearance were measured. When talking on a mobile phone, participants’ overall body velocity (mean(sd): Ascent 0.534(0.026) vs 0.511(0.024) m/s, Descent 0.642(0.026) vs 0.511(0.024) m/s, No phone/Phone respectively) and cadence decreased significantly (Ascent 75.8(5.8) vs 65.6(4.4) steps/min, Descent 117.4(4.2) vs 108.6(6.0) steps/min, No Phone/Phone respectively). Pelvis and feet jerk cost also changed significantly, mostly decreasing with phone use. Foot clearance did not show significant changes between No Phone and Phone conditions. These pilot results show that, even for young, healthy and cognitively intact individuals, talking on a mobile phone whilst negotiating a staircase induces measurable changes in motor performance. Participants moved slowly but more smoothly, reducing the motor control cost, possibly at the expense of movement accuracy. The reduction in motor performance is likely to be due to the difficulty in integrating the two sub-tasks. These results suggest that even young, healthy individuals show stair gait impairment when simultaneously negotiating stairs and performing another cognitive task, such as talking on the phone.",

    "doi": "10.1016/j.apergo.2019.103007",
    "abstract": "Objective To ascertain the reliability of a standardised, short-scale measure of satisfaction in the use of new healthcare technology i.e., the LITE version of the usability metric for user experience (UMUX-LITE). Whilst previous studies have demonstrated the reliability of UMUX-LITE, and its relationship with measures of likelihood to recommend a product, such as the Net Promoter Score (NPS) in other sectors no such testing has been undertaken with healthcare technology. Materials and methods Six point-of-care products at different stages of development were assessed by 120 healthcare professionals. UMUX-LITE was used to gather their satisfaction in use, and NPS to declare their intention to promote the product. Inferential statistics were used to: i) ascertain the reliability of UMUX-LITE, and ii) assess the relationship between UMUX-LITE and NPS at different stages of products development. Results UMUX-LITE showed an acceptable reliability (α = 0.7) and a strong positive correlation with NPS (r = 0.455, p < .001). This is similar to findings in other fields of application. The level of product development did not affect the UMUX-LITE scores, while the stage of development was a significant predictor (R2 = 0.49) of the intention to promote. Discussion and conclusion Practitioners may apply UMUX-LITE alone, or in combination with the NPS, to complement interview and ‘homemade’ scales to investigate the quality of new products at different stages of development. This shortened scale is appropriate for use in the context of healthcare in which busy professionals have a minimal amount of time to support innovation.",

    "abstract": "The structural features of work boots worn by underground coal miners affect comfort, foot motion and, in turn, loading of the plantar surface of miners’ feet. Although shaft stiffness and sole flexibility appear to be boot design features that could influence perceived comfort and plantar pressures, no study has systematically altered these boot design features to truly understand how they affect these parameters. This study aimed to systematically investigate the effect of changes to shaft stiffness and sole flexibility on perceived comfort and plantar pressures when 20 males walked on a simulated gravel coal mining surface under four different work boot conditions. There were no significant effects of shaft stiffness or sole flexibility on perceived comfort. However, shaft stiffness and sole flexibility each significantly affected the plantar pressures generated under the medial midfoot, heel, middle metatarsals and hallux and, in combination, affected plantar pressures generated beneath the lateral midfoot, medial and lateral metatarsals and lesser toes. Participants preferred a boot with a flexible shaft combined with a stiff sole, citing properties such as fit, moveability, walking effort and support to explain why they perceived one boot as more comfortable than another. We therefore recommend that underground coal mining work boots should be designed to incorporate different flexibility and stiffness between the shaft and sole of the boot to optimise foot movement and, in turn, walking efficiency.",

Many studies report a relationship between discomfort and pressure distribution, but it is unknown what exactly is happening in the interaction. The purpose of this study is to present a measuring device, which records the comfort relevant seat parameters pressure and elongation while loading a seat. The results of the study, including the repeatability, reproducibility and detectability show that the measurement method is appropriate for our purpose, although the reproducibility has to be improved by operator experience or by a more intuitive assembling of the measurement setup. An application example illustrates that the interaction of the seat components highly affect the resulting comfort relevant parameters. The question is whether this objectively recorded differences are also experienced by seat occupants, which is interesting to study in future research.",

Our case study shows the importance of culture, infrastructure, and strong leadership support in realizing a learning health systems research project and creating sustainable change within the health system.

    "doi": "10.1016/j.apergo.2019.103011",
    "abstract": "This paper extends an earlier examination of the concept of ‘mesoergonomics’ (Karsh et al., 2014) and its application to Human Factors/Ergonomics (HFE). Karsh et al. (2014) developed a framework for mesoergonomic inquiry based on a set of steps and questions, the purpose of which was to encourage researchers to cross system levels in the studies (e.g., organisation-group-individual levels of analysis) and to explore alternative causal mechanisms and relationships within their data. The present paper further develops the framework and draws on previous work across a diverse range of sources (safety science, systems theory, the sociology of disaster and ethology) which has examined the subject of accident causation, levels of analysis and explanatory factors contributing to system failure. The outcomes from this exercise are a revised framework which seeks to explore what we term ‘isomorphisms’ and includes questions covering: (a) how internal isomorphisms develop or evolve within the system; and, (b) how these isomorphisms are shaped by cultural, professional and other forms of external influence. The workings of the revised framework are illustrated through using the example of the UK NHS Morecambe Bay Investigation (Kirkup, 2015). The paper concludes with a summary of ways forward for the framework, as well as new directions for theory within systems ergonomics/human factors.",

    "journal": "Applied Ergonomics",
    "year": "2020",
    "doi": "10.1016/j.apergo.2019.103007",
    "abstract": "Objective To ascertain the reliability of a standardised, short-scale measure of satisfaction in the use of new healthcare technology i.e., the LITE version of the usability metric for user experience (UMUX-LITE). Whilst previous studies have demonstrated the reliability of UMUX-LITE, and its relationship with measures of likelihood to recommend a product, such as the Net Promoter Score (NPS) in other sectors no such testing has been undertaken with healthcare technology. Materials and methods Six point-of-care products at different stages of development were assessed by 120 healthcare professionals. UMUX-LITE was used to gather their satisfaction in use, and NPS to declare their intention to promote the product. Inferential statistics were used to: i) ascertain the reliability of UMUX-LITE, and ii) assess the relationship between UMUX-LITE and NPS at different stages of products development. Results UMUX-LITE showed an acceptable reliability (α = 0.7) and a strong positive correlation with NPS (r = 0.455, p < .001). This is similar to findings in other fields of application. The level of product development did not affect the UMUX-LITE scores, while the stage of development was a significant predictor (R2 = 0.49) of the intention to promote. Discussion and conclusion Practitioners may apply UMUX-LITE alone, or in combination with the NPS, to complement interview and ‘homemade’ scales to investigate the quality of new products at different stages of development. This shortened scale is appropriate for use in the context of healthcare in which busy professionals have a minimal amount of time to support innovation.",

    "abstract": "The advent of electronic documentation systems has made it easy to generate and store vast amounts of information, and has enabled easy access to patient care information, so much so that they are now considered a critical infrastructure for supporting the cognitive tasks in healthcare work. But, electronic documentation systems are not without their share of problems. Accountability and liability requirements have made electronic information creation and documentation particularly challenging. Mandatory documentation requirements and templated electronic formats have increased the amount of information, but have not always resulted in reliable, useful, or meaningful information. Documentation systems have become rigid, offering little opportunity for healthcare providers to engage in meaningful conversations about the information, and to sense problem status without additional coordination. A particularly significant information interaction problem that we have identified from our field work in healthcare information modeling, which this paper focuses on, deals with what we term creator-consumer interaction behaviors. The purpose of this paper is to examine in-depth the problem of creator-consumer information interaction behaviors in electronic healthcare documentation systems. A creator-consumer interaction behavioral framework highlights satisficing behavior during creation and consumption of medical documentation, and the characteristics of the work system that may lead to satisficing on documentation tasks.",

    "abstract": "Multidisciplinary incident management teams (IMTs) are required to operate in resilient ways as emergency situations unfold unexpectedly. Although resilience in emergency management has been widely studied in many emergency contexts, the development of a new method to investigate actual resilient performance of the IMTs under realistic settings has been limited. To address such gap, this paper first introduces Interaction Episode Analysis (IEA), a novel approach to capture and describe emergent team performance. As an exploratory observation study, we apply the IEA to an information management aspect of the IMTs in two emergency exercises carried out in a high-fidelity environment. As a result, the IEA provides comparable sets of episodes as instances of work-as-done, rendering opportunities to further analyze essential elements of interactions between team members as well as information management activities. Moreover, the IEA enables comparisons between the observations and identification of challenges faced by the team in managing incident information and adaptive behaviors used to address the challenges. By gathering more evidences as well as addressing limitations identified in this study, the IEA is expected to serve as a method that facilitates the analysis of work-as-done of complex team work and the reconciliation between work-as-done and work-as-imagined to promote resilience in emergency management.",

As care becomes increasingly distributed over space and time, the “process” component of the SEIPS model needs to evolve and represent this additional complexity. In this paper, we review different ways that the process component of the SEIPS models have been described and applied. We then propose the SEIPS 3.0 model, which expands the process component, using the concept of the patient journey to describe the spatio-temporal distribution of patients’ interactions with multiple care settings over time. This new SEIPS 3.0 sociotechnical systems approach to the patient journey and patient safety poses several conceptual and methodological challenges to HFE researchers and professionals, including the need to consider multiple perspectives, issues with genuine participation, and HFE work at the boundaries.",

    "abstract": "Cyber threats are targeting vulnerabilities of human workers performing tasks in manufacturing processes, including visual inspection to bias their decision-making, thereby sabotaging product quality. This article examines the use of priming as a form of “cognitive hacking” to adversely affect quality inspection decisions in manufacturing, and investigates physiological measurements as means to detect such intrusion. In a within-subject design experiment, twenty participants inspected surface roughness of a manufactured component with and without exposure to priming on the display of an inspection logging system. The results show that the presence of primes impacted accuracy on surface roughness, cortical activities at parietal lobe P4, and eye gaze for inspecting components. The experiment provides supporting evidence that basic hacking of a worker display can be an effective method to alter decision making in inspection. The findings also illustrate that cortical activities and eye gaze can be useful indicators of cognitive hacking. A major implication of the study results is that physiological indicators can be effective at revealing unconscious cognitive influence in visual inspection.",

    "abstract": "Introduction Primary care is complex due to multiple health problems being addressed in each patient visit. Little is known about the effect of the number of problems per encounter (NPPE) on the resulting clinician workload (CWL), as measured using the National Aeronautics and Space Administration Task Load Index (NASA-TLX). Methods We evaluated the relationship between NPPE and CWL across 608 adult patient visits, conducted by 31 clinicians, using hierarchical linear regression. Clinicians were interviewed about outlier visits to identify reasons for higher or lower than expected CWL. Results Mean NPPE was 3.30 ± 2.0 (sd) and CWL was 47.6 ± 18.4 from a maximum of 100. Mental demand, time demand and effort accounted for 71.5% of CWL. After adjustment for confounders, each additional problem increased CWL by 3.9 points (P < 0.001). Patient, problem, environmental and patient-physician relationship factors were qualitatively identified from interviews as moderators of this effect. Conclusion CWL is positively related to NPPE. Several modifiable factors may enhance or mitigate this effect. Our findings have implications for using a Human Factors (HF) approach to managing CWL.",

    "title": "Effectiveness of the multi-component dynamic work intervention to reduce sitting time in office workers – Results from a pragmatic cluster randomised controlled trial",

    "doi": "10.1016/j.apergo.2019.103027",
    "abstract": "Objective Prolonged sitting, which is highly prevalent in office workers, has been associated with several health risks. The aim of this study was to evaluate the Dynamic Work intervention by determining its effect on total sitting time at the 8-month follow-up in comparison to the control. Methods This two-arm pragmatic cluster randomised controlled trial included 244 office workers from 14 different departments of a large, Dutch insurance company. The Dynamic Work intervention was a real-life, worksite intervention that included environmental components (i.e. sit-stand workstations), organisational components (i.e. group sessions), and individual components (e.g. activity/sitting trackers). Outcomes were assessed at baseline, 4-month follow-up, and 8-month follow-up. The primary outcome was total sitting time per day, objectively assessed using the activPAL activity monitor at 8-month follow-up. Secondary outcomes included other total and occupational movement behaviour outcomes, health-related outcomes, and work-related outcomes. Data analyses were performed using linear and logistic mixed models. Results Total sitting time did not differ between the intervention and control group at the 8-month follow-up. Secondary outcomes also showed no difference between the intervention and control group at either the 4-month or at 8-month follow-up, with the exception of number of occupational steps, which showed a statistically significant effect at 4-month follow-up (but not at 8-month follow-up) of 913 (95% CI = 381–1445) steps/8-h working day. Conclusions This study evaluated the effectiveness of a real-life worksite intervention to reduce sitting time and showed little to no effect. This may be due to the relatively low intensity of the intervention, i.e. that it only involved the replacement of 25% of sitting workstations with sit-stand workstations. Future research should focus on the evaluation of more intensive real-life worksite interventions that are still feasible for implementation in daily practice.

    "abstract": "Observation-based risk assessments are often used for evaluation of biomechanical workload and the condition of the workplace ergonomics. However, the inter- and intra-rater reliability of the methods used for the assessments are insufficiently studied. The OCRA checklist method, included as a reference method in the ISO and CEN standards regarding upper limb repetitive risk assessment, was in this study investigated regarding its reliability. Eleven ergonomists were educated within the method. Each ergonomist risk-assessed ten video-recorded manual work tasks, on two occasions. The average inter-rater agreement of the five overall risk levels was 39% and the linearly weighted kappa was 0.43, the intra-rater dittos were 45% and 0.52. Both indicating a moderate reliability, but lower than what could be expected. The levels might be sufficient for coarse surveys. However, for risk assessments before and after an intervention, complementing technical methods should be considered.",

We aimed to investigate the neck and shoulder discomfort experienced during prolonged microscopic activity and to assess the benefits of minibreaks. A prospective crossover study was performed on 17 healthy volunteers sitting still while looking down a bench with and without the Ipswich Microbreak Technique (IMT). We used a subjective measure of time to fatigue and pain in the neck and shoulder regions as well as objective readings from a surface electromyogram (sEMG). The IMT delayed the sensation of pain in the neck and shoulder region while reducing the overall sEMG muscle activation. In conclusion, IMT is a useful strategy in reducing and delaying the pain in neck and shoulder from prolonged working under the microscope. This technique can be incorporated in other activities that involve a sustained stationary position.",

    "year": "2020",
    "doi": "10.1016/j.apergo.2019.102982",
    "abstract": "Introduction The aim of this paper is to examine gender differences in the occurrence of accidents among workers while walking to or from their workplace (non-vehicle commuting accidents). We have previously found that the lower limb is more often injured at work among women, compared to men, so the paper concentrates on lower limb injuries. Methods Using the records of the National Institute for Insurance against Injuries at Work (INAIL), we focused on the non-vehicle commuting accidents of women and men recognized as work-related for the period 2013-2017. In particular, we examined the gender difference by work sector and type of trauma suffered with particular attention to lower limb injuries. Results The rate of non-vehicle commuting accidents (n. 60,936) among women was significantly higher than for men (1.29‰ vs 0.40‰ men, p < 0.001) for the period studied. Lower limb injuries (50.5% for women and 43.7% for men, p < 0.001) constituted the large majority of these injuries. In particular, dislocation of the ankle (78% for women vs 65.5% for men, p < 0.001), bruise of the knee (71.2% for women vs 54.9% for men, p < 0.001) and fracture of the foot (41% for women vs 33.6% for men, p < 0.001) were all significantly higher among women. The work sectors with higher injury rates were: Transport and Warehouse, Public Administration, Health and care services and Wholesale and retail trade. This result may be due to wear and tear from conditions at work. The women injured were on the average, a decade older than men (50-59 vs 40-49 years old). Conclusions Non-vehicle commuting represents an important, albeight neglected, preventable risk for women workers, causing lower limb trauma particularly at the ankle, the foot and the knee. These areas may be particularly injure-prone among women in specific sectors, due to the work environment. Effective prevention of these injuries requires gender-oriented ergonomic actions at work and in the commuting environment.",

    "abstract": "Activity-based Flexible Offices (AFOs) are innovations in workspace design that are being increasingly implemented in organisations. While most studies investigate satisfaction and perceived work support in AFOs, employees' workspace preferences are not addressed in the literature. The aims of this study were to (i) identify workspace preferences and non-preferences in AFOs, and (ii) investigate whether employees’ workstation choices support their activities and align with their preferences. Two Swedish municipalities participated in the study. Data collection involved 27 semi-structured interviews and annotations on architectural drawings. The results showed that the interviewees preferred workstations that were both desirable and functional, and avoided workstations that were undesirable. This was due to functional, social, emotional and symbolic aspects of the workspaces as well as their physical structure and stimuli. The approach used in this paper can be adopted for improving the design of AFOs, thereby mitigating the stress of finding a suitable workstation.",

    "abstract": "The automotive industry is chugging along towards full autonomy, with a yet unknown time of arrival. The next call, however, is partial driving automation. At this interim station lurks many dangers, there-among them issues surrounding the partial performance of the driving task. Despite their potential for increased safety, these systems come with many inherent limitations and caveats, and their safe use depend on drivers correctly understanding their new role. Training is proposed as a potentially effective method of introducing drivers to the central aspects in this human-automation interaction. A proof-of-concept training program designed to introduce drivers to a partial automation system was developed. The effects of training were then evaluated through a between-group mixed-methods simulator experiment. Results indicate that trained drivers both self-report and exhibit an improved understanding of the automation system. They also report a significantly higher inclination to retake control in critical situation, than do their untrained counterparts.",

    "doi": "10.1016/j.apergo.2018.12.013",
    "abstract": "Biomechanical overload in the wrist flexor and extensor muscles, together with awkward hand positions during work activities, can result in occupational wrist and hand disorders. Dairy workers, specifically those that work in the milking parlor, are exposed to highly repetitive and forceful exertions of the upper limb throughout their work shift. There are very few studies that have investigated the determinants that contribute to the risk of distal upper limb musculoskeletal disorders among dairy workers. The purpose of the present study was to identify the variables affecting the biomechanical overload of the distal upper limb among milking parlor workers, define risk profiles, and propose possible interventions to reduce the high physical loads to the distal upper limb during milking activities. Forty male workers from the three most common milking parlor systems in Lombardy Italy were recruited to participate in this study. Multiple correspondence analysis of personal characteristics and occupational risk factors, followed by cluster analysis, led to the identification of three distinct groups of workers. Low, medium and high risk profiles were assigned to each group based on the risk assessments performed using the Strain Index and electromyography of the distal upper limb. The main risk determinants were workstation characteristics, work organization and milking routine. A well-organized milking routine, milking cluster weight below 2.4 kg or the use of supporting arms for the milking cluster may reduce the risk of biomechanical overload.",

Data was collected on demographic, occupational, and socioeconomic indicators and musculoskeletal disorders. Results revealed that children engaged in strenuous work. Ergonomic exposures differed by sex/gender, with girls more likely to engage in repetitive movements and boys in heavy lifting. Girls bore a double burden of work inside and outside their households and were more prone to wrist and hand pain. More girls reported working under pressure to finish their job on time while more boys reported that their salary is based on finishing a specific number of items per day. Syrian refugee child workers need immediate protection to safeguard their health. Interventions could target children of legal age for work in safer conditions and keep younger children out of work.",

    "abstract": "This study investigated the biomechanical loads and kinematics of workers during multiple-task manual material handling (MMH) jobs, and developed prediction models for the moments acting on a worker's body and their peak joint angles. An experiment was conducted in which 20 subjects performed a total of 3780 repetitions of a box-conveying task. This task included continuous sequential removing, carrying and depositing of boxes weighing 2–12 kg. The subjects' motion was captured using motion-capture technology. The origin/destination height was the most influencing predictor of the spinal and shoulder moments and the peak trunk, shoulder and knee angles. The relationship between the origin/destination heights and the above parameters was nonlinear. The mass of the box, and the subject's height and mass, also influenced the spinal and shoulder moments. A tradeoff between the moments acting on the L5/S1 vertebrae and on the shoulder joint was found. Compared to the models developed in similar studies that focused on manual material handling (albeit under different conditions), the high-order prediction equation for peak spinal moment formulated in the present study was found to explain between 10% and 48% more variability in the moments. This suggests that using a high-order equation in future studies might improve the prediction.",

    "abstract": "Communication in teams plays a vital role in team success. This work proposes Fuzzy Cognitive Maps (FCMs) as a formalized, team communication methodology for the analysis of content and flow, simultaneously, of naturalistic team communication in a structured environment. Several methods of analysis of team communication exist. Few of them, however, analyze the flow and content of communication simultaneously, and none with teams using naturalistic language. Team communication data is coded for flow and content (through speech acts), then turned into FCMs for visual and statistical analysis. Results show that when using the FCM methodology both flow and content of communication can be diagrammed at the individual level, however, when assessing at the team level, what is illustrated is the flow of content. The application of different statistical analyses to the FCM output provides the opportunity to answer various questions on team communication. This study demonstrates that by using speech acts (SAs) as nodes, FCMs can illustrate and analyze team communication flow and content for naturalistic language. The FCM methodology is a powerful tool for studying team communication, and further incremental work could advance knowledge in team communication dynamics and provide contributions to graph theory. This method provides a visual overview of team communication dynamics in a naturalistic language setting, thus allowing for the study of intra-team dynamics and inter-team dynamics simultaneously.",

Without correction no correlation between the Cosinuss° and thermometer pill (ICC≤0.09, p ≥ 0.154, LoA≥1.37) and a moderate correlation between Cosinuss° and inner-ear infrared (ICC = 0.40, p = 0.044, LoA±1.20) was observed. With individual correction both correlations were excellent (ICC≥0.84, p = 0.000, LoA≤0.30). However, during and after working all correlations were poor and non-significant (ICC≤0.38, p ≥ 0.091, LoA≥1.71). During firefighting tasks, the Cosinuss° is invalid for measuring the core temperature. No differences in heat development in the two types of protective clothing was proven.",

These physiological changes can result in slight to drastic changes in body dimensions. Any drastic change in body dimensions is critical information for current and future space hardware designers. These changes can affect accommodation, safety, and performance of a crewmember while in space. This study measured the overall change in seated height and stature for crewmembers exposed to a microgravity environment. Seated height data were obtained from 29 crewmembers that included 8 International Space Station increment crew (2 females and 6 males) and 21 Shuttle crew (1 female and 20 males). The results indicate that all participating crewmembers experienced statistically significant change in seated height. The corresponding change, 6% from preflight, should be considered for vehicle designs as the necessary seated microgravity adjustment.",

    "abstract": "Purpose The aim of the present study was to identify the most physically demanding work tasks for Swedish ground combat soldiers through the development and application of a questionnaire survey. This is the first in a series of studies aiming to describe the development process and validation of physical selection standards in the Swedish armed forces. Methods Based on procedural documentation, combat manuals and job analyses, a questionnaire was developed that defined and rated the perceived physical strain of 30 work tasks for ground combat soldiers. To assess validity, an expert focus group was used and psychometric analysis performed. The questionnaire was then distributed to 231 ground combat soldiers, of whom 165 responded (71%). Results The questionnaire was validated in three steps to achieve face and content validity, and internal consistency was acceptable (Chronbach's alpha ≥0.95). Of the 30 work tasks included in the survey, transport of wounded was rated as the most demanding task for both aerobic capacity and strength. Other highly demanding tasks for aerobic capacity included combat movement (low/high crawl), dismounted attack in close country, urban and rough terrain and carrying heavy loads. There were no gender differences for either aerobic or strength demands in the top five most challenging tasks based on proportions. Conclusions This study identified the most physically demanding tasks performed in the Swedish ground combat forces. Almost all the physically demanding tasks found in the present study contain elements of lifting and carrying, which require muscular strength and muscular endurance, with no gender differences.",

    "abstract": "For parents working in the transportation industry, atypical schedules are often a daily puzzle. Schedule planning systems allowing workers to choose shifts may affect job strenuousness and work-family balance (WFB) for both female and male workers. How could ergonomic interventions related to the implementation of those systems better consider gender dynamics regarding WFB strategies, and minimize inequities among workers? This article presents a joint analysis of two independent case studies related to ergonomic interventions in transport companies in Canada and Switzerland. Direct observation and semi-structured interviews shed light on the characteristics of schedule planning systems and their interaction with men's and women's WFB strategies. Issues related to each step of the planning process (shift construction, schedule choice, day-to-day schedule management) are discussed to inform interventions aimed at facilitating WFB, and ultimately gender equity, in atypical schedule contexts.",

We therefore devised two variants of the seminal brainstorming technique to favor ideation during design activities. One variant encouraged participants to focus on the evocation of ideas, like the seminal technique, whereas the other emphasized the evocation of constraints related to the design problem. To analyze the effects of these variants on creative design, we conducted three studies: one with future designers (Study 1), one with future generalist teachers (Study 2), and one with future teachers specializing in creative activities (Study 3). Depending on the study, participants were provided with idea evocation instructions, constraint evocation instructions, or no specific instructions. Results allowed us to identify the best conditions for promoting creativity in design, depending on the individual's specialty or the complexity of the design task.",

    "abstract": "Standing computer work is increasingly popular. However, despite the higher rates of computer work-related disorders in women, no studies have compared how standing work affects men and women. Twelve males and 12 females completed 90-min typing tasks in each posture while electromyography (EMG) data was recorded from eight muscles of the upper body. Results show that females had significantly higher EMG root-mean-squared (RMS) values in the anterior deltoid than males when seated, but higher EMG RMS in the medial trapezius than males when standing (SBC ≤ 0.05). In standing, they also had lower values than males in the erector spinae. Overall, standing elicited less activity in the upper trapezius, wrist extensors and erector spinae than sitting. Results suggest that the standing posture is generally less muscularly demanding than the seated one, although men and women's neck/shoulder musculature responds differently to the same task performed while seated or standing.",

    "abstract": "Powered two-wheeler riders are frequently involved in crashes at intersections because an approaching car driver fails to give right of way. This simulator study aimed to investigate how riders perform an emergency braking maneuver in response to an oncoming car and, second, whether longitudinal motion cues provided by a motion platform influence riders' braking performance. Twelve riders approached a four-way intersection at the same time as an oncoming car. We manipulated the car's direction of travel, speed profile, and its indicator light. The results showed that the more dangerous the situation (safe, near-miss, impending-crash), the more likely riders were to initiate braking. Although riders braked in the majority of trials when the car crossed their path, they were often unsuccessful in avoiding a collision with the car. No statistically significant differences were found in riders' initiation of braking and braking style between the motion and no-motion simulator configurations.",

    "abstract": "Cybersickness, i.e. visually induced motion sickness, remains as a negative effect that is detrimental to the user experience of VEs (virtual environments) developed for VR (virtual reality) consumers. As the VR technology evolves, it is rather triggered by application aspects rather than hardware limitations. For this reason, there is still a need for a measurement method to assess and compare VEs for cybersickness effects. SSQ (Simulation Sickness Questionnaire) is used for measuring users’ level of sickness symptoms and is highly appreciated in VR research. However, it is criticized for its psychometric qualities and applicability in VR, as a measure of cybersickness. Recently, two variants of SSQ were offered for measuring cybersickness, CSQ (Cybersickness Questionnaire) and VRSQ (Virtual Reality Sickness Questionnaire). There is also another variant with a different factor structure, which we call FSSQ, that is based on French translation of SSQ. Our study compares SSQ and these variants for their psychometric qualities; construct validity, discriminant validity, internal reliability, test-retest reliability and sensitivity to distinguish application aspects of VEs that are related to cybersickness. Using a within-subjects experiment design, we evaluated 7 different VEs with 32 participants through 9 sessions, resulting with 288 responses to the 16-item SSQ. Results suggested that both VRSQ and CSQ were valid and reliable measures of cybersickness, as well as being sensitive to application aspects such as translational and rotational movements required by users for navigation in VEs. Compared to SSQ and FSSQ; the cybersickness questionnaires, CSQ and VRSQ, revealed better indicators of validity. On the other hand, we assume that the development of the two cybersickness scales had limitations in sample size to represent VR consumers and limitations in stimuli to represent the applications aspects of consumer VEs. We suggest further evaluation of cybersickness symptoms with larger samples and broader range of applications to identify the symptoms and the construct of a subjective measurement tool.",

    "abstract": "Last (and First) mile deliveries are an increasingly important and costly component of supply chains especially those that require transport within city centres. With reduction in anticipated manufacturing and delivery timescales, logistics personnel are expected to identify the correct location (accurately) and supply the goods in appropriate condition (safe delivery). Moving towards more environmentally sustainable supply chains, the last/first mile of deliveries may be completed by a cyclist courier which could result in significant reductions in congestion and emissions in cities. In addition, the last metres of an increasing number of deliveries are completed on foot i.e. as a pedestrian. Although research into new technologies to support enhanced navigation capabilities is ongoing, the focus to date has been on technical implementations with limited studies addressing how information is perceived and actioned by a human courier. In the research reported in this paper a comparison study has been conducted with 24 participants evaluating two examples of state-of-the-art navigation aids to support accurate (right time and place) and safe (right condition) navigation. Participants completed 4 navigation tasks, 2 whilst cycling and 2 whilst walking. The navigation devices under investigation were a handheld display presenting a map and instructions and an in-sight monocular display presenting text and arrow instructions. Navigation was conducted in a real-world environment in which eye movements and device interaction were recorded using Tobii-Pro 2 eye tracking glasses. The results indicate that the handheld device provided better support for accurate navigation (right time and place), with longer but less frequent gaze interactions and higher perceived usability. The in-sight display supported improved situation awareness with a greater number of hazards acknowledged. The benefits and drawbacks of each device and use of visual navigation support tools are discussed.",

    "abstract": "This study aimed to operationalise and use the World Health Organisation's International Classification for Patient Safety (ICPS) to identify incident characteristics and contributing factors of deaths involving complications of medical or surgical care in Australia. A sample of 500 coronial findings related to patient deaths following complications of surgical or medical care in Australia were reviewed using a modified-ICPS (mICPS). Over two-thirds (69.0%) of incidents occurred during treatment and 27.4% occurred in the operating theatre. Clinical process and procedures (55.9%), medication/IV fluids (11.2%) and healthcare-associated infection/complications (10.4%) were the most common incident types. Coroners made recommendations in 44.0% of deaths and organisations undertook preventive actions in 40.0% of deaths. This study demonstrated that the ICPS was able to be modified for practical use as a human factors taxonomy to identify sequences of incident types and contributing factors for patient deaths. Further testing of the mICPS is warranted.",

    "abstract": "There is increasing evidence that subjects who are exposed to long sitting periods suffer from musculoskeletal discomfort and back pain. The underlying mechanism and effective prevention strategies are still largely unknown. In this study, muscle stiffness of the back was measured in 59 office workers who followed their usual desk work regime for 4.5 h in a sitting posture. The sitting period was either followed by an 8-min roller massage intervention or a controlled standing task. Results showed that muscle stiffness increased significantly after the 4.5 h sitting period. When the sitting period was followed by roller massage, the stiffness values dropped slightly below baseline stiffness. In contrast, the stiffness values remained increased when the sitting period was followed by controlled standing. This study indicates that short-duration tissue manipulation can be an effective active break between prolonged sitting periods to prevent musculoskeletal issues, such as musculoskeletal discomfort and back pain.",

    "abstract": "Health and safety inductions are ubiquitous in construction but tend to be poorly designed and suffer low levels of worker engagement. In this paper we report on the evaluation of an innovative, full day, actor-based health and safety induction called EPIC, currently being used on London's Thames Tideway Tunnel megaproject. As of March 2019, more than 14,000 individuals had attended EPIC. This evaluation examines the impact of EPIC from the perspective of participants and other stakeholders, and considers the utility of actor-based immersive health and safety inductions for use more widely, in both construction and other sectors. Using a mixed-method, longitudinal approach to data collection, EPIC is evaluated against Kirkpatrick's (1959) ‘four levels’ framework of reactions, learning, behaviour change and results. This paper discusses factors which support and hinder actor-based inductions, and the challenges involved in assessing the impact of inductions on subsequent behaviour and health and safety outcomes.",

    "doi": "10.1016/j.apergo.2019.102952",
    "abstract": "In contrast to the conventional safety philosophy (Safety-I) which focuses on ‘what goes wrong’, a newborn one (Safety-II) focusing on ‘what goes right’ endows people with more opportunities to realize productive safety in complex socio-technical systems. Yet, it is challenging to make the best of both the philosophies in a period of knowledge transition when they may have to coexist. This work investigates how Safety-II may resemble, differ from, and correlate to Safety-I. From individual, environmental and organizational aspects, 9 impacting factors are identified and expounded comparatively in the two philosophies. To examine impact of the factors on accidents and resilience respectively, an empirical approach is presented in the context of Beijing taxi service system (BTSS). Multiple means such as questionnaire surveys, semi-structured interviews, and statistical analysis with bi-method (Correlation Analysis, and Data Envelopment Analysis) cross-checking are utilized comprehensively to support the empirical study. The results show that: a) individual factors play a dominant role in system risk/performance management, in respect to views of both Safety-I and II; and b) organizational factors are more influential in creating and maintaining system resilience. Based on the findings, possible patterns of integrating the two philosophies are instantiated through mutually complementary application to BTSS. Despite the context of BTSS, this work provides a feasible way of comparing between Safety-I and Safety-II, for beneficial reference of other socio-technical systems.",

    "abstract": "Resilient systems strive to enhance the safety of complex systems through building and developing adaptive technological and organizational capacities. This study aims at analyzing and improving the level of adaptive capacity in a petrochemical plant by means of an integrated quantitative approach. The data were gathered by a questionnaire whose reliability is examined by statistical methods. To compute and analyze the influence of resilience engineering (RE) indicators, teamwork, and redundancy on adaptive capacity, data envelopment analysis (DEA) method was used. The results indicate that teamwork and redundancy have a positive effect on enhancing the level of adaptive capacity. Multilayer perceptron (MLP), a machine learning approach, was used to estimate the level of adaptive capacity on the basis of a dataset. The results of DEA and MLP approaches are confirmed by statistical methods. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study that measures quantitatively and improves adaptive capacity by an integrated DEA-MLP approach based on the stress-strain model. The outcomes of this study could assist managers and other decision-makers of complex systems to compute and improve the level of adaptive capacity for coping with upcoming events in abnormal conditions.",

    "year": "2020",
    "doi": "10.1016/j.apergo.2019.102914",
    "abstract": "There is a growing body of studies indicating that extended shift duration has an adverse effect on fatigue, consequently leading to reduced work performance and higher risk of accident. Following modern fatigue risk management systems (FRMS), acceptable performance could be maintained by the mobilization of appropriate mitigation strategies. However, the effective deployment of such strategies assume that workers are able to assess their own level of fatigue-related impairments. In this study, we sought to determine whether emergency physicians’ subjective feelings of sleepiness could provide accurate knowledge of actual fatigue-related impairments while working extended shifts. We conducted a prospective observational study with a within-subjects repeated measures component. We collected sleep logs, sleepiness ratings and reaction times on a Psychomotor Vigilance Task (PVT) at different time points during shifts. Our results show that the PVT is sensitive to sleep loss and fatigue, with a 10% increase in mean reaction time across the shift. Subjective sleepiness, however, showed no significant association with time since awakening and was not a significant predictor of PVT performance. Our results are consistent with experimental studies showing that individuals tend to underestimate fatigue-related impairments when sleep deprived or functioning under adverse circadian phase. The discrepancy between subjective sleepiness and actual fatigue-related impairments may give workers the illusion of being in control and hinder the deployment of mitigation strategies. Further research is needed to determine the relative weight of circadian phase shifting and cumulative sleep deprivation in the decline of self-knowledge in extended shifts.",

For these patients, personal health information management (PHIM) is an integral part of daily life, and largely occurs within the home. However, the way in which the home supports PHIM has not been systematically investigated. The present study examined how members of the diabetic population use features of the home environment to support PHIM. Participants (N = 60) explored a simulated home environment, the VR CAVE, and identified the most useful features for performing three examples of PHIM tasks. The computer was perceived as the most useful feature for PHIM. However, perceived usefulness of features varied based on the PHIM task performed and the rooms in which features appeared. We conclude that a detailed study of the affordances of features is necessary to ease the burden of managing chronic illness, particularly diabetes mellitus, in the sociotechnical system of the home.",

    "abstract": "Available coefficient of friction (ACOF) is a common metric of footwear traction performance. ACOF is the ratio of friction to normal force, often averaged over a time-interval. The time-interval needed to achieve repeatable and valid ACOF is unknown. A post-hoc analysis was performed on nine shoe-floor-contaminant combinations to assess the repeatability and bias of data averaged across 4 time-intervals (2 ms, 50 ms, 100 ms, 200 ms) after the target normal force was reached. The ability to predict human slips was assessed for ACOF across these intervals. Differences in repeatability and validity across the four intervals were small. However, statistically significant differences were observed for the shortest compared with the longest interval (lower repeatability yet modestly improved predictive ability). Given the limited impact of time-interval on the results, a shorter interval of 50 ms is recommended to enable testing of smaller floor samples.",

This study measured the effect of wearing state-of-the-art PPC and personal protective equipment (PPE), with the possible effect of clothing layers and fit, on physiological responses including metabolic rate (MR) and muscle activation level. 19 male participants (80.2 ± 5.9 kg, 181.5 ± 5.1 cm) wore five different clothing ensembles during level (0°) and inclined (6°) walking. Compared to a base layer ensemble (388.7 ± 42.7 W/737.8 ± 57.9 W), wearing a 3-layer PPC ensemble (421.5 ± 44.7 W/811.7 ± 69.2 W) significantly increased MR, and adding PPE (458.3 ± 59.8 W/864.5 ± 71.2 W) further increased MR during level/inclined walking. Independent of the extra weight, adding a middle layer between base layer and outer clothing significantly increased MR during inclined walking only, and no effect of oversized outer clothing was measured.",

    "abstract": "The aim was to describe occupational physical activity (OPA) and examine the role of psychosocial job resources among blue-collar workers. In a sample of 198 workers (57% male; mean age 44.9 (SD 9.9) year) from 7 companies in Denmark, two accelerometers (Actigraph) were placed on the thigh and trunk during 1–5 consecutive days, to determine working time spent standing, walking, on feet and in activity of moderate to vigorous intensity level (MVPA). The level of influence and social support at work were assessed by questionnaire. The exposure to OPA significantly varied by particular job type, especially in male predominant occupations. Overall, psychosocial job resources did not affect the exposure to OPA. These findings suggest that workplace interventions aiming to prevent adverse outcomes of OPA among blue-collars workers ought to focus on task redesign and target work organizational factors related to specific job type.",

This study investigates the contribution of Safety Performance Measurement Systems (SPMS) as a means for monitoring and understanding of sources of complexity and resilience in construction. It is based in three empirical studies carried out in construction projects, two in Chile and one in Brazil. Two main tools were applied in these studies: (i) the Technical, Organizational and Environmental (TOE) framework, focused on complexity; and (ii) the Resilience Assessment Grid (RAG), focused on resilience. Improvement opportunities were identified for existing SPMS. Also, a set of guidelines for the design of SPMS emerged from these studies as well as a model that explains the connections between the main constructs encompassed by the guidelines.",

    "abstract": "Objective Effective teamwork is critical to patient safety across multiple healthcare settings. However, current observational tools assessing teamwork performance tend to be developed for specific settings or tasks and do not capture temporal features of interaction. This study aimed to develop a valid and reliable observational teamwork behaviour framework, which is based on healthcare practice, applicable across a variety of healthcare contexts and can be used to capture temporal team dynamics. Methods Team interactions were audio-visually recorded during routine simulation training at two large clinical education centres specialising in physical and mental healthcare. The framework was based on theoretical models of teamwork and was developed in three steps: 1-micro analysis of verbal and nonverbal behaviour during recorded scenarios (n = 20); 2-iterative test and refine cycles; 3-final behavioural framework applied to a cohort of acute emergency scenarios (n = 9) by two raters to assess inter-rater agreement. Results The framework contains twenty-three specific verbal and nonverbal behaviours that can be identified during observations. Behaviours are grouped conceptually based on their function resulting in thirteen behavioural functions, which cluster into five overarching teamwork domains. Inter-rater agreement was excellent (Cohen's Kappa = .84, SE = 0.03). Conclusion We present a valid and reliable behavioural framework, grounded in teamwork theory and empirical observations of clinical team behaviour. This framework enables analysis of the nuances and temporal features of clinical practice in depth and across a wide range of clinical contexts and settings. Use of this framework will advance our understanding of teamworking in healthcare.",

    "doi": "10.1016/j.apergo.2019.102953",
    "abstract": "In this article, we analyse flight crew response to an in-flight powerplant system malfunction (PSM) using control task analysis. We demonstrate the application of the decision ladder template and the skills, rules, and knowledge (SRK) framework to this new area of inquiry. Despite the high reliability of turbofan engines, accidents and incidents involving PSM still occur. During these unusual events, flight crew have not always responded appropriately, leading to a reduction in safety margins or disruption of operations. This article proposes recommendations for technological and information system that can support flight crew in responding safely and appropriately to a PSM. These recommendations focus on new ways in which information from engine health monitoring system and other sources of data can be utilised and displayed. Firstly, we conducted knowledge elicitation using Critical Decision Method (CDM) interviews with airline pilots who have experienced real or simulated PSM events. We then developed generic decision ladders using the interview data, operations manual, training manual, and other guideline documents. The generic decision ladders characterise the different stages of responding to PSM identified as part of the research. These stages include: regaining and maintaining control of aircraft, identifying PSM and selecting appropriate checklists to secure the engine, and modifying the flight plan. Using the decision ladders and insights from the CDM interviews, we were able to identify cognitive processes and states that are more prone to errors and therefore more likely to generate an inappropriate response. Using the SRK framework, we propose design recommendations for technological and information systems to minimise the likelihood of such inappropriate response. We conclude that this combination of methods provides a structured and reliable approach to identifying system improvements in complex and dynamic work situations. Our specific contributions are the application of these techniques in the unrepresented area of flight operations, and the development of evidence-based design recommendations to improve flight crew response to in-flight powerplant system malfunctions.",

    "abstract": "We aim to use a macrocognition theoretical perspective to characterize contributors to diagnostic delays by physicians that can be mitigated by work system redesign. As experienced with other complex, sociotechnical domains, system redesign is anticipated to be more effective at improving safety than training-based solutions. In the outpatient care setting, complex tasks, conducted by a primary care provider, are provided for five macrocognition functions: sensemaking, re-planning, detecting problems, deciding, and coordinating. Redesigning systems could reduce delays to diagnosis by helping users to avoid missed symptoms, forgotten follow-up activities, and delayed actions. Health information technology could support resilience strategies by offloading documentation burdens, recording working diagnoses, displaying planned follow-up activities at the correct time interval, and supporting recognition of patterns in patient care. These insights suggest a path forward for future research on system design innovations to reduce diagnostic delays, and ultimately, reduce patient harm.",

    "abstract": "Sit-stand desks can reduce occupational sitting time, however, their cost can limit scalability. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the impact of a low-cost standing desk on objectively-measured occupational sitting and prolonged sitting bouts over 3- and 6-months. Secondary outcomes included self-report work engagement and occupational fatigue. Forty-eight office employees (91.7% female, Mage = 39.8 ± 10.1) were randomized to receive a low-cost standing desk or to a control group. At 3-months, the intervention group sat 0.7 h (42min) less at work compared to the control group; F(1, 45) = 5.90, partial η2 = 0.12, p = .019. The effect was small, yet comparable to findings from studies using costlier alternatives. However, these reductions were not maintained at 6-months. No changes in prolonged sitting bouts or secondary outcomes were found. There is some potential for low-cost standing desk converters as a scalable workplace health intervention.

    "abstract": "This paper evaluates a method for motion-based prediction of external forces and moments on manual material handling (MMH) tasks. From a set of hypothesized contact points between the subject and the environment (ground and load), external forces were calculated as the minimal forces at each contact point while ensuring the dynamics equilibrium. Ground reaction forces and moments (GRF&M) and load contact forces and moments (LCF&M) were computed from motion data alone. With an inverse dynamics method, the predicted data were then used to compute kinetic variables such as back loading. On a cohort of 65 subjects performing MMH tasks, the mean correlation coefficients between predicted and experimentally measured GRF for the vertical, antero-posterior and medio-lateral components were 0.91 (0.08), 0.95 (0.03) and 0.94 (0.08), respectively. The associated RMSE were 0.51 N/kg, 0.22 N/kg and 0.19 N/kg. The correlation coefficient between L5/S1 joint moments computed from predicted and measured data was 0.95 with a RMSE of 14 Nm for the flexion/extension component. In conclusion, this method allows the assessment of MMH tasks without force platforms, which increases the ecological aspect of the tasks studied and enables performance of dynamic analyses in real settings outside the laboratory.",

    "abstract": "Traction testing of footwear is expensive, which may create barriers for certain users to assess footwear. This study aimed to develop a statistical model that predicts available coefficient of friction (ACOF) under boundary lubrication conditions based on inexpensive measurements of footwear outsole features. Geometric and material hardness parameters were measured from fifty-eight footwear designs labeled as slip-resistant. A robotic friction measurement device was used to quantify ACOF with canola oil as the contaminant. Stepwise regression methods were used to develop models based on the outsole parameters and floor type to predict ACOF. The predictive ability of the regression models was tested using the k-fold cross-validation method. Results indicated that 87% of ACOF variation was explained by three shoe outsole parameters (tread surface area, heel shape, hardness) and floor type. This approach may provide an assessment tool for safety practitioners to assess footwear traction and improve workers’ safety.",

    "abstract": "Although the modelling of interactions has long been at the core of socio-technical systems theory, and is a key for understanding resilience, there is a lack of a holistic taxonomy of interactions. This study introduces a taxonomy of interactions to be used in association with the Functional Resonance Analysis Method (FRAM). The taxonomy has nine criteria: nature of agents, output nature, levelling, waiting time, distance, degree of coupling, visibility, safety and/or security hazards, and parallel replications. For each criterion, two descriptors are proposed: what the interaction looks like; and - when applicable - the variability level of the interaction. The use of the taxonomy is presented for three systems with clearly distinct complexity characteristics: cash withdrawal from an ATM, teaching a university course, and manufacturing operations. These case studies indicate the usefulness of the taxonomy for the identification of leverage points in work system design. They also show the value of modelling the variability of the interactions in FRAM models, in addition to the traditional modelling of the variability of the outputs of functions. Implications of the taxonomy for resilience engineering are discussed.",

    "abstract": "Background Consumer virtual reality (VR) devices are becoming more prevalent in the market, but cybersickness induced by VR devices limits their potential application and promotion. Acustimulation has been found effective in reducing cybersickness symptoms. However, in previous forms, the more effective way of acustimulation is either intrusive or electrical which is hard to be applied to daily VR use. Purpose In this study, we aimed to find a both simple and more effective acustimulation approach, acupressure plus acupaste (AcP+) to reducing the adverse effects caused by cybersickness from VR applications. Method In this study, we set three conditions: acupressure plus acupaste (AcP+) (main condition of interest), acupressure with fake acupaste (AcP), and a no acustimulation condition (NoAcP). In AcP and AcP + conditions, we applied acupressure or acupressure with true acupaste on P6 point before conducting video-watching tasks using VR headsets, while in NoAcP condition, participants received no special treatment before video-watching tasks. We used questionnaires to measure symptoms of cybersickness and compared the results between these 3 conditions, especially between acupressure plus acupaste (AcP+) and acupressure (AcP) to examine the effect of AcP+, and compared AcP and AcP+ with NoAcP to confirm the effect of acustimulation. Result Participants reported significant fewer symptoms of cybersickness nausea feelings in both acustimulation methods, compared with NoAcP; and AcP+ was more effective than AcP against cybersickness on visual oculomotor aspect, and facilitated cybersickness recovery. Implication It would be promising to develop acupressure equipment and apply stimulation before VR application to reduce cybersickness.",

    "abstract": "This study investigated the effects of aerial ladder rung spacing on firefighter climbing biomechanics. Ten female and 9 male firefighters ascended and descended instrumented ladders with rungs spaced at 356 mm (current design) and 305 mm in a laboratory setup. The climbing tests were performed at five ladder slope and handrail conditions: 30° with low (305 mm) and high (914 mm) handrails, 52.5° with and without a low handrail, and 75° without a handrail. Foot and hand forces and body movements were recorded and used to calculate joint moments of the upper and lower body. Reduced rung spacing resulted in reduced foot forces, reduced hand forces, and reduced ankle transverse moment. It was also associated with increased climbing speed for female climbers, and increased ankle vertical overshoot. The results indicate that reduced rung spacing on aerial ladders may lead to lower biomechanical stress; better climbing efficiency and safety; and reduced climbing speed disparity across sexes.",

    "abstract": "In order to detect automation failures in a timely manner, operators are required to monitor automated systems efficiently. The present study analysed eye movements to predict whether or not participants could detect an automation failure. Eye movements were recorded whilst 101 participants were monitoring an automated system where automation failures occurred at irregular intervals. A main result is that about 75.6 per cent of automation failure detections were predicted successfully by the corresponding eye movements. In cases where failures were detected successfully, relevant information is monitored more often and more intensively, in particular shortly before an automation failure happens and while it is happening. The findings are discussed in the context of the personnel selection and training of aviation operatives, as well as incident reporting as used in air traffic control (ATC).",

    "abstract": "The purpose was to evaluate whether a cold-water immersion test could be used to identify individuals susceptible to local cold injuries (LCI). Sixty-five healthy non-injured (N–I) subjects, and fifteen subjects, who were tested either prior to or after a LCI, sequentially immersed one hand and one foot, in 8 °C water for 30 min (CWI phase); this was followed by 15 min of spontaneous rewarming (RW phase). The LCI group showed a lower toe temperature during the CWI phase, and a lower maximum RW temperature of the fingers than the N–I group. However, digit temperatures during the CWI and RW phases exhibited low predictive values for LCI, e.g. results implied that to identify 80% of the LCI subjects, 34–78% of the N–I subjects would also be excluded. Thus, the results suggest that, in practice, hand or foot cold-water immersion tests cannot be used to identify individuals at high risk of LCI.",

    "abstract": "Repetitive and intensive exercises during robot-aided rehabilitation may expose patients to inappropriate and unsafe postures. The introduction of a sensory feedback can help the subject to perform the rehabilitation task with an ergonomic posture. In this work, the introduction of visual and vibrotactile feedback in a robotic platform for upper limb rehabilitation has been proposed to ensure ergonomic posture during rehabilitation. The two feedback modalities have been used to provide information about incorrect neck and trunk posture. Ten healthy subjects have been involved in this study. Each of them performed 3D reaching movements with the aid of the robotic platform in three different conditions, i.e. without feedback, with visual feedback and with vibrotactile feedback, and a comparative analysis has been carried out to evaluate feedback effectiveness, acceptance and performance. Experimental results show that in case of no feedback the subjects reach and maintain configurations that can lead to incorrect neck and trunk configurations and therefore, if repeated, to musculoskeletal disorders. Conversely, with visual or vibrotactile feedback, the subjects tend to correct inappropriate posture with both trunk and head during task performing.",

The findings offer an overview of various categories of impacts, such as changes in partners’ views, in workplace settings and conditions, in practices and policies, and in economic outcomes. In these types of IR, health effects measurement is not the main objective, and direct health outcomes are difficult to assess.

    "abstract": "In this paper we study the working conditions of Community Health Workers in performing house calls within low-income, violent communities in order to understand the challenges in delivering primary care in developing countries. We conducted field studies in two primary healthcare clinics and telephone surveys for 5 months in 2017 within systematic sample of 1690 community health workers based on clinics distributed along the health regions of the city of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. A number of 759 interviews were completed, approximately 50% of the sample, 86% men and 14% women. Most participants are 30–39 years old (35%), followed by 27% of 40–49 years old participants. Results show that exposure to territorial violence and environmental or health-related diseases significantly affects CHWs. Moreover, CHWs have to develop a significant set of skills to cope with aspects of the territory, and those skills are not present in their training. As community health workers work on the sharp end of the healthcare system, responsible for outreaching, community education, counseling, and social support, our study presents contributions to government and management levels on working conditions inside communities, constraints in assistance, and difficulties in implementing primary care policies.",

    "doi": "10.1016/j.apergo.2019.102914",
    "abstract": "There is a growing body of studies indicating that extended shift duration has an adverse effect on fatigue, consequently leading to reduced work performance and higher risk of accident. Following modern fatigue risk management systems (FRMS), acceptable performance could be maintained by the mobilization of appropriate mitigation strategies. However, the effective deployment of such strategies assume that workers are able to assess their own level of fatigue-related impairments. In this study, we sought to determine whether emergency physicians’ subjective feelings of sleepiness could provide accurate knowledge of actual fatigue-related impairments while working extended shifts. We conducted a prospective observational study with a within-subjects repeated measures component. We collected sleep logs, sleepiness ratings and reaction times on a Psychomotor Vigilance Task (PVT) at different time points during shifts. Our results show that the PVT is sensitive to sleep loss and fatigue, with a 10% increase in mean reaction time across the shift. Subjective sleepiness, however, showed no significant association with time since awakening and was not a significant predictor of PVT performance. Our results are consistent with experimental studies showing that individuals tend to underestimate fatigue-related impairments when sleep deprived or functioning under adverse circadian phase. The discrepancy between subjective sleepiness and actual fatigue-related impairments may give workers the illusion of being in control and hinder the deployment of mitigation strategies. Further research is needed to determine the relative weight of circadian phase shifting and cumulative sleep deprivation in the decline of self-knowledge in extended shifts.",

    "abstract": "The purpose of this study was to assess the impact of fit on female versus male firefighter range of motion (ROM) when donning a structural turnout ensemble. Three test ensembles were evaluated: base layers (BL), turnout suit (TS), and turnout ensemble (TE). Sixteen career firefighters (10 males; 6 females) completed a user needs survey on fit and mobility restrictions, were measured in a three-dimensional body scanner, performed a static ROM protocol, and recorded ease of movement and comfort perceptions for each ensemble. Average body measurements and absolute ROM values were calculated for each test ensemble and analyzed by gender. Results demonstrated multiple significant differences in body measurements between male and female firefighters when wearing the BL and TS test ensembles. Mobility was significantly reduced when donning the TS and TE, regardless of gender. Significant differences in trunk and shoulder flexion when wearing turnout suits were identified according to participant gender.",

    "abstract": "Sleep inertia, the state of reduced alertness upon waking, can negatively impact on-call workers. Anticipation of a stressful task on sleep inertia, while on-call was investigated. Young, healthy males (n = 23) spent an adaptation, control and two counterbalanced on-call nights in the laboratory. When on-call, participants were told they would be woken to a high or low stress task. Participants were not woken during the night, instead were given a 2300-0700 sleep opportunity. Participants slept ∼7.5-h in all conditions. Upon waking, sleep inertia was quantified using the Karolinska Sleepiness Scale and Psychomotor Vigilance and Spatial Configuration Tasks, administered at 15-min intervals. Compared to control, participants felt sleepier post waking when on-call and sleepiest in the low stress compared to the high stress condition (p < .001). Spatial performance was faster when on-call compared to control (p < .001). Findings suggest that anticipating a high-stress task when on-call, does not impact sleep inertia severity.",

    "abstract": "This study investigated the effects of cue plausibility in a baggage screening task. 120 participants had to indicate whether a prohibited item was present in a series of grey-scaled X-ray images of baggage. They were assisted by a support system, which pointed at the location of a suspicious object. A 2 × 2 × 2 between-subjects design was used. Cue plausibility for false alarms (i.e. how the cued object was similar to a prohibited item) and support system reliability were manipulated at two levels (high/low). Furthermore, half of participants were provided with a rationale about automation failures (RAF) to reduce their negative impact on trust and performance. The results showed lower performance and more compliance with automation suggestions when cues were implausible than plausible. The RAF increased the response time and did not improve detection performance. Overall, this suggests that effective (computer-based) training is needed to reduce the negative effect of plausible cues.",

    "abstract": "This study evaluated the effectiveness and acceptance of four connected vehicle features, i.e. Emergency Electronic Brake Lights (EEBL), Emergency Vehicle Warning (EVW), Roadworks warning (RWW) and Traffic Condition Warning (TCW) which were presented via a mobile phone mounted near the line of sight. A driving simulator study was conducted in which 36 drivers were exposed to different levels of urgent and critical situations. They involved the approach of an emergency vehicle, an emergency braking of a lead vehicle, a roadworks area and a congested section of a road. All these events took place in a simulated motorway scenario. In the EEBL event, the vehicle braking ahead with the brake lights on was either visible or not (between-subjects). Whereas no effect of RWW and TCW were observed on driving behaviour, results showed that drivers who were shown the EEBL warnings had shorter braking and decelerating response times, and a slower mean speed during the events, and this was independent of brake lights visibility. The EVW resulted in participants giving way to the emergency vehicle (i.e. staying on the slow lane instead of overtaking slower vehicles) more frequently than those who did not receive the warning. The mobile phone app was accepted and considered usable. Locating the mobile phone in different locations within the drivers' line of sight (i.e. dashboard, instrument cluster) did not impact significantly neither drivers’ attitudes nor behaviour. Additional in-vehicle information systems could enhance safety and allow emergency vehicles to get faster to their destination.",

Yet, HIT has yet to achieve its putative benefits of higher quality, safer, and lower cost care. There has been variable but largely marginal progress at addressing the 12 HIT fallacies delineated in the original paper. Here, we revisit several of the original fallacies and add five new ones. These fallacies must be understood and addressed by all stakeholders for HIT to be a positive force in achieving the high value healthcare system the nation deserves. Foundational cognitive and human factors engineering research and development continue to be essential to HIT development, deployment, and use.",

The review revealed a robust and growing body of literature on patient ergonomics, particularly in the areas of aging and chronic disease, tools and technologies, and evaluations of patient-centered interventions on outcomes such as usability, user acceptance, and performance. Findings highlighted gaps deserving future research, including research with understudied populations such as children, informal caregivers, networks and collectives (groups), and marginalized populations; on topics such as health promotion and transitions of care; and using longitudinal and experimental study designs. The growth of patient-centeredness in general and of patient ergonomics in particular compel other more focused reviews, new primary research, and developing a roadmap for future patient ergonomics research.",

Results showed that with the effect of the belt, the % maximum voluntary contraction of the lumbar erector spinae was reduced significantly by nearly 10%. Muscle activity was significantly increased in thoracic erector and multifidus spinae during wheelchair-to-bed transfer, compared to bed-to-wheelchair transfers. There was no significant effect of belt or task on the spinal angular displacement in different spinal regions. Using the transfer belt was associated with a significantly decreased score for perceived exertion. In conclusion, this study supports the use of a transfer belt contributing to lower muscle activity and lower perceived physical exertion in the low back.",

    "doi": "10.1016/j.apergo.2019.102976",
    "abstract": "Signal passed at danger (SPAD) events have been a perennial issue in rail and requires continued scholarship. Much of the literature has tended to focus on activities within the train cab, placing the spotlight on “error” within the rail driving role; however a train is not propelled by a single person but by a team. This study set out to understand how network controllers perceive the relationship dynamic between the network controller and rail driver, and how these views shape system performance. Using a phenomenological approach underpinned by Joint Cognitive Systems theory, interviews were conducted with network controllers (N = 55) across 8 rail organisations in Australia and New Zealand to examine how they related to signals and to drivers. Sixteen different perspectives were identified ranging in type and varying by frequency, each with implications for coupling strength between the controller and driver roles and on system performance. Key dimensions of teamwork in train movement were emphasised, illustrating how the underlying values and philosophies in different network controlling cultures influence risk perception. The findings may be used to develop a more informed understanding of the ‘controller-signal-driver-train’ system and pave the way for strategies that can embrace diversity in different perspectives whilst optimizing system safety and performance.",

    "abstract": "Partially automated vehicles present interface design challenges in ensuring the driver remains alert should the vehicle need to hand back control at short notice, but without exposing the driver to cognitive overload. To date, little is known about driver expectations of partial driving automation and whether this affects the information they require inside the vehicle. Twenty-five participants were presented with five partially automated driving events in a driving simulator. After each event, a semi-structured interview was conducted. The interview data was coded and analysed using grounded theory. From the results, two groupings of driver expectations were identified: High Information Preference (HIP) and Low Information Preference (LIP) drivers; between these two groups the information preferences differed. LIP drivers did not want detailed information about the vehicle presented to them, but the definition of partial automation means that this kind of information is required for safe use. Hence, the results suggest careful thought as to how information is presented to them is required in order for LIP drivers to safely using partial driving automation. Conversely, HIP drivers wanted detailed information about the system's status and driving and were found to be more willing to work with the partial automation and its current limitations. It was evident that the drivers' expectations of the partial automation capability differed, and this affected their information preferences. Hence this study suggests that HMI designers must account for these differing expectations and preferences to create a safe, usable system that works for everyone.",

An experiment was conducted in which 12 paramedic teams (each including two paramedics) performed in-situ simulations of a cardiac-arrest scenario. CPR quality was evaluated using five standard resuscitation measures (i.e., pre- and post-shock pauses, and compression rate, depth and fraction). The spinal loads while lifting, pulling and pushing the equipment bags were assessed using digital human modeling software (Jack) and prediction equation from previous studies. The results highlight where paramedics are currently choosing to position their equipment. They also demonstrate that the positions of the equipment bags affect CPR quality as well as the paramedics' work efficiency, physiological effort and biomechanical loads. The spinal loads ranged from 1901 to 4030N; furthermore, every occasion on which an equipment bag was lifted resulted in spinal forces higher than 3400N, thus exceeding the maximum threshold stipulated by the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health. 72% of paramedics' postures were categorized as high or very high risk for musculoskeletal disorders by the Rapid Entire Body Assessment. Guidelines related to bag positioning and equipment handling might improve CPR quality and patient outcomes, and reduce paramedics’ risk of injury.",

    "abstract": "Comfortable light emitting diode (LED) lighting conditions were examined for psychological and physiological responses. Eight male and eight female subjects participated in a series of experiments. They were exposed to light emitted from LED lights of 3000 K in the ranges of 150–400 lux and 1500–5000 lux; 4000 K in the ranges of 140–640 lux and 2000–5000 lux; and 5000 K in the ranges of 70–270 lux and 2500–7000 lux. Illuminance at a given correlated color temperature was first maintained at the lowest value in the designated range and then increased in a stepwise manner. On reaching the highest value in the range, it was then decreased to the lowest value in a stepwise manner. The subjects were required to indicate their perception of brightness, glare, and comfort at the controlled illuminance levels. Electrocardiogram and electroencephalogram data were monitored continuously throughout exposure. The results showed that the boundary illuminances estimated from psychological and physiological responses did not significantly differ between male and female subjects, but differed markedly from those of fluorescent lights tested in a previous study. The high boundaries of the LED lights were higher than those of the fluorescent lights. The low boundaries of the LED lights at 3000 K and 4000 K were higher than those of the fluorescent lights, but the boundaries at 5000 K were lower than those of the fluorescent lights. These differences may be due to differences in the spectral distribution and luminance for a given illuminance between LED and fluorescent lights.",

    "year": "2020",
    "doi": "10.1016/j.apergo.2019.102943",
    "abstract": "Drivers’ non-compliance with rules is a prominent factor in collisions with trains at railway level crossings. Road user impatience and frustration has been identified as an underlying factor in non-compliance and can be characterised as a specific risk factor. However, research on non-compliance related to waiting times and driver inconvenience lacks in the literature. This paper, therefore, seeks to enhance the currently limited understanding of the relationship between waiting times and risky driver behaviour. An Advanced Driving Simulator was used to obtain objective measures of level crossing non-compliance. Subjective measures on driver frustration and decision-making processes were also collected. Sixty participants completed six driving tasks each, with the tasks varying in terms of traffic conditions, number of trains and associated waiting times. This study shows that increased waiting times result in higher levels of frustration and an increased likelihood of risky driving behaviour, particularly for waiting times longer than 3 min. Non-compliance included entering the activated crossing before boom gates are down, entering the crossing after the train passage but before signals are deactivated, stopping/reversing on the crossing. Subjective data revealed that participants did not comply with level crossing rules due to factors including time pressure, impatience/frustration and low perceived risk. The results suggest that, where possible, waiting times should be standardised at values lower than 3 min to reduce the likelihood of risky road user behaviour.",

    "abstract": "Lifting equipment can reduce the risk of injury from patient handling, but limited availability and adoption have been a persistent problem. Data from statewide surveys of California nurses (N = 389) in 2013 and 2016 were analyzed to evaluate lift use, perceptions about lifts and injury risk, and musculoskeletal symptoms by type of available lifts. Nurses with ceiling lifts (23%) were significantly more likely to use lifts and had more positive perceptions about lifts, regarding worker safety, patient safety and comfort, ease of use, access, and storing, than nurses with only floor lifts (77%). Nurses with ceiling lifts reported less low back pain and shoulder pain. Our study findings suggest that providing ceiling lifts can result in superior outcomes to floor-based lifts in multiple aspects, including better acceptance and use by nurses for patient handling, as well as being associated with reduced work-related musculoskeletal symptoms in the low back and shoulders.",

    "abstract": "‘Safety-II’ is a new approach to safety, which emphasizes learning proactively about how safety and efficacy are achieved in everyday frontline work. Previous research developed a new lesson-sharing tool designed based on the Safety-II approach: Resilience Engineering Tool to Improve Patient Safety (RETIPS). The tool comprises questions designed to elicit narratives of adaptations that have contributed to effectiveness in care delivery. The purpose of this study is to revise and validate the design of RETIPS. The tool was revised based on feedback of clinicians at a large multi-specialty hospital, resulting in a version customized for anesthesia residents, RETIPS-AnRes. RETIPS-AnRes was administered on a pilot-basis to anesthesia resident groups for a limited period of time. A review of the reports obtained shows a strong alignment of responses with the conceptual basis of the tool, i.e. learning about how things go well in everyday work. The exemplars include both, specific instances of successful patient care, as well as generic routines that contribute to safe and/or effective care delivery. These findings support RETIPS as a tool to operationalize the Safety-II paradigm in healthcare. Lessons and implications for implementation on a wider scale are discussed.",

    "abstract": "A recent systematic review identified 73 empirical studies that linked human factors (HF) with manufacturing quality. Human fatigue was noted as a frequent (n = 26) issue in the HF-quality relationship – a finding that warrants closer examination. We extend this review by investigating the relationship between fatigue and manufacturing quality by identifying how fatigue has been conceptualized and measured, and we attempted to quantify their relationship. From the original database, 12 of 26 relevant studies (46%) indicated that physical fatigue was the primary contributor to observed quality deficits. There was a positive relationship between fatigue and quality deficits, with fatigue accounting up to 42% of the variance. More studies are needed to improve the resolution, specificity, and power of these analyses. This study sheds light on the role of HF and human fatigue effects on manufacturing quality with macroergonomic implications for embedding HF aspects into design and quality assurance processes.",

    "abstract": "Lifting equipment can reduce the risk of injury from patient handling, but limited availability and adoption have been a persistent problem. Data from statewide surveys of California nurses (N = 389) in 2013 and 2016 were analyzed to evaluate lift use, perceptions about lifts and injury risk, and musculoskeletal symptoms by type of available lifts. Nurses with ceiling lifts (23%) were significantly more likely to use lifts and had more positive perceptions about lifts, regarding worker safety, patient safety and comfort, ease of use, access, and storing, than nurses with only floor lifts (77%). Nurses with ceiling lifts reported less low back pain and shoulder pain. Our study findings suggest that providing ceiling lifts can result in superior outcomes to floor-based lifts in multiple aspects, including better acceptance and use by nurses for patient handling, as well as being associated with reduced work-related musculoskeletal symptoms in the low back and shoulders.",

    "abstract": "Firefighters and EMS providers continue to be challenged when lifting heavy patients in their homes. This study investigated the biomechanical efficacy of four devices that could be used by two-person teams when lifting patients from the floor, from a reclining chair, or from a Simulated Inflatable Seat at chair height. Fourteen firefighter-paramedics, working in two-person teams, were instrumented with motion capture and electromyographic sensors. The Binder Lift™, the Simple Strap, and the Slip Preventer were used to lift patient actors, and were compared to current lifting methods. Postural data and the peak dynamic spine shear forces at the L5/S1 level were reduced when using the Simple Strap, the Binder Lift, and the Simulated Inflatable Seat. The Slip Preventer reduced spine flexion when the Binder Lift was not used. In summary, the tested devices can potentially reduce the biomechanical loads experienced by EMS providers as they lift and move patients.",

    "abstract": "In the present research, models based on multivariate adaptive regression splines (MARS) are proposed to study the influence of gender in the factors affecting the development of shoulders, neck and upper limb MSD. Two different MARS models, corresponding to men and women, are constructed to identify variables with the strongest effect on the target MSD. Both models are capable to predict successfully the occurrence of the studied disorders. Men seem to be more vulnerable to physical risk factors and some other working conditions, whereas women appear to be more affected by psychosocial risk factors and activities carried out outside their working hours. According to the results, gender needs to be considered to ensure the success and effectiveness of ergonomic interventions on the whole working population.",

    "abstract": "Equivocal findings exist for the economy associated with load carried close to the body's centre of mass. Individual variation could explain some of the equivocal findings. This research aimed to examine the extent of individual variation in loaded walking economy. Eighteen females carried load on the back, head and split between the front and back. Individual variation in relative load carriage economy (ELI) was primarily assessed using standard deviation, coefficients of variation (CV) and intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC). There was large inter-individual variation in ELI values with highest mean CV's of 16%, 12% and 10% for head-, back- and combined front and back-loading. Mean ELI values were not significantly different between methods. The large amount of individual variation found here suggests future load carriage research should account for individual variation, particularly when considering sample size and when making inferences on the economy associated with different types of load carriage using group mean data.",

    "abstract": "Although worksite interventions increase physical activity, little is known about their effects on work ability. The objective of this scoping review was to examine the extent, range and nature of interventions to promote work ability by increasing the physical activity or decreasing the sedentary time of sedentary workers in order to identify implications for health promotion at workplaces. We searched Medline, Cochrane Central, and Scopus and identified 29 intervention studies. Using an iterative method, we provided an overview of the study elements and extracted details on study sample, design, intervention content, outcomes, and beneficial effects. Most of the studies (N = 25) were RCTs. Thirteen studies reported beneficial effects on work ability. Tailored and group-based interventions and interventions including environmental actions were often beneficial (9/13). We identified features of feasible and effective interventions for promoting work ability by increasing the physical activity or decreasing the sedentary time of sedentary workers. However, more studies are needed on the sustainability of these effects, and versatile interventions tailored to workers and work demands.",
