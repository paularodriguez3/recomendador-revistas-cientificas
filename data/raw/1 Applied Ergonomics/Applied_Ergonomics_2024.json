    "abstract": "With the diversification of Internet uses, online content type has become richer. Alongside organic results, search engine results pages now provide tools to improve information searching and learning. The People also ask (PAA) box is intended to reduce users' cognitive costs by offering easily accessible information. Nevertheless, there has been scant research on how users actually process it, compared with more traditional content type (i.e., organic results and online documents). The present eye-tracking study explored this question by considering the search context (complex lookup task vs. exploratory task) and users' prior domain knowledge (high vs. low). Main results show that users fixated the PAA box and online documents more to achieve exploratory goals, and fixated organic results more to achieve lookup goals. Users with low knowledge process PAA content at an early stage in their search contrary to their counterparts with high knowledge. Given these results, information system developers should diversify PAA content according to search context and users’ prior domain knowledge.",

    "abstract": "Integrating Artificial Intelligence (AI) and drone technology into bridge inspections offers numerous advantages, including increased efficiency and enhanced safety. However, it is essential to recognize that this integration changes the cognitive ergonomics of the inspection task. Gaining a deeper understanding of how humans process information and behave when collaborating with drones and AI systems is necessary for designing and implementing effective AI-assisted inspection drones. To further understand human-drone-AI intricate dynamics, an experiment was conducted in which participants’ biometric and behavioral data were collected during a simulated drone-enabled bridge inspection under two conditions: with an 80% accurate AI assistance and with no AI assistance. Results indicate that cognitive and behavioral factors, including vigilance, cognitive processing intensity, gaze patterns, and visual scanning efficiency can influence inspectors' performance respectively in either condition. This highlights the importance of designing inspection protocols, drones and AI systems based on a comprehensive understanding of the cognitive processes required in each condition to prevent cognitive overload and minimize errors. We also remark on the visual scanning and gaze patterns associated with a higher chance of missing critical information in each condition, insights that inspectors can use to enhance their inspection performance.",

    "abstract": "Understanding the operator's cognitive workload is crucial for efficiency and safety in human–machine systems. This study investigated how cognitive workload modulates cardiac autonomic regulation during a standardized military simulator flight. Military student pilots completed simulated flight tasks in a Hawk flight simulator. Continuous electrocardiography was recorded to analyze time and frequency domain heart rate variability (HRV). After the simulation, a flight instructor used a standardized method to evaluate student pilot's individual cognitive workload from video-recorded flight simulator data. Results indicated that HRV was able to differentiate flight phases that induced varying levels of cognitive workload; an increasing level of cognitive workload caused significant decreases in many HRV variables, mainly reflecting parasympathetic deactivation of cardiac autonomic regulation. In conclusion, autonomic physiological responses can be used to examine reactions to increased cognitive workload during simulated military flights. HRV could be beneficial in assessing individual responses to cognitive workload and pilot performance during simulator training.",

    "abstract": "This analysis examined systemic causes of Uncrewed Air Vehicle (UAV) accidents identifying operator, environmental, supervisory, and organisational factors through the use of the Human Factors Analysis and Classification System (HFACS). HFACS is a system-based analysis method for investigating the causal factors associated with accidents and incidents and has previously been used to reliably and systematically identify active and latent failures associated with both military and general aviation accidents. Whilst HFACS has previously been applied to UAV accidents, the last known application was conducted in 2014. Using reports retrieved from nine accident investigation organisations’ databases, causal factors were coded against unsafe acts, preconditions, and failures at the supervisory, organisational, and environmental levels. Causal factors were assessed on 77 medium or large UAV mishaps/accidents that occurred over a 12-year period up to 2024. 42 mishap reports were deemed to involve a human factor as a causal factor. A large proportion of the mishaps contained factors attributed to Decision Errors at level 1 (Unsafe Acts) which was found to be associated with both the Technological Environment and Adverse Mental State at level 2 (Pre-conditions). Causal factors were identified at each of the other 3 levels (Supervisory, Organisational and External) with a number of emergent associations between causal factors. These data provide support for the identification and development of interventions aimed at improving the safety of organisations and advice of regulators for Uncrewed Air Systems.",

    "doi": "10.1016/j.apergo.2024.104369",
    "abstract": "Mode awareness is important for the safe use of automated vehicles, yet drivers' understanding of mode transitions has not been sufficiently investigated. In this study, we administered an online survey to 838 respondents to examine their understanding of control responsibilities in partial and conditional driving automation with four types of interventions (brake pedal, steering wheel, gas pedal, and take-over request). Results show that most drivers understand that they are responsible for speed and distance control after brake pedal interventions and steering control after steering wheel interventions. However, drivers have mixed responses regarding the responsibility for speed and distance control after steering wheel interventions and the responsibility for steering control after gas pedal interventions. With a higher automation level (conditional driving automation), drivers expect automation to remain responsible more often compared to a lower automation level (partial driving automation). Regarding Hands-on requirements, more than 99% of respondents answered that drivers would keep their hands on the steering wheel after all intervention types in partial automation, while 60–95% would place their hands on the wheel after various intervention types in conditional automation. A misalignment between actual logic and drivers' expectations regarding control responsibilities is observed by comparing survey responses to the mode transition logic of commercial partially automated vehicles. To resolve confusion about control responsibilities and ensure consistent expectations, we propose implementing a consistent mode design and providing enhanced information to drivers.",

    "abstract": "Industrial robots are increasingly commonplace, but research on prototypical accidents and injuries has been sparse, hindering evidence-based safety strategies. Using Severe Injury Reports (SIRs) from the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), we identified 77 robot-related accidents from 2015-2022. Of these, 54 involved stationary robots, resulting in 66 injuries, mainly finger amputations and fractures to the head and torso. Mobile robots caused 23 accidents, leading to 27 injuries, mainly fractures to the legs and feet. A two-stage deductive–inductive thematic analysis was performed using text data from the final narratives in the reports to discover patterns in tasks, precipitating mechanisms, and contributing factors. Findings highlight the need for guards and collision avoidance systems that detect individual extremities. Post-contact strategies should focus on mitigating finger amputations. More structured and detailed narratives in the SIRs are needed.",

    "abstract": "Robot-assisted surgery (RAS) differs from traditional OR set-ups in several ways such as operation of technology and obstructed team communication that potentially affect surgical staff's stress experiences. The current study investigates the effects of key intraoperative job demands and resources on mental workload and perceived stress in RAS. We focused on the role of intraoperative teamwork as a resource that potentially reduces occupational stress. Combining standardized expert observations in the OR with healthcare providers' self-reports, the study involved two types of robot-assisted, urological interventions. The sample consisted of 73 observed surgeries and included 242 post-operative surveys on perceived stress and mental workload from surgeons and surgical nurses. Multilevel regression analyses reveal differential effects for stress and workload. Importantly, whereas better surgical teamwork was associated with lower stress, it was unrelated to workload. Our findings provide a nuanced picture of occupational stress in RAS, particularly regarding the role of intraoperative teamwork.",

    "abstract": "Fall injuries often occur on extension ladders. The extendable fly section of an extension ladder is typically closer to the user than the base section, though this design is minimally justified. This study investigates the effects of reversing the fly on foot placement, frictional requirements, adverse stepping events (repositioning the foot or kicking the rung), and user preferences. Participant foot placement was farther posterior (rung contacted nearer to toes) in the traditional ladder compared to the reversed fly condition during descent, with farther anterior foot placements during ascent. The reversed configuration had similar friction requirements during early/mid stance and significantly lower frictional requirements during late stance. Increased friction requirements during late stance were associated with farther anterior foot placement and further plantar flexed foot orientation. The reversed fly had 5 adverse stepping events versus 22 that occurred in the traditional configuration. Users typically preferred the reversed fly. These results suggest that a reversed extension ladder configuration offers potential benefits in reducing fall-related injuries that should motivate future research and development work.",

    "doi": "10.1016/j.apergo.2024.104372",
    "abstract": "When designing footwear products, designers and kinesiologists usually factor in plantar surface pressure, motion capture data, and subjective comfort evaluations. However, these factors alone are not sufficient to guide the design of truly comfortable shoes. Pressure pain threshold (PPT) is a parameter that establishes a connection between psychological quantities and physical quantities. The purpose of this study was to construct a high-precision PPT map of the whole foot. Overall, 20 participants were included in this study, and an electronic, mechanical algometer was used to apply constant pressure to the participants' feet. A MATLAB graphical user interface was developed to simplify the data-collecting process and generate visual representations of the data. Finally, several high-precision unisex, different sex, and dominant side PPT maps were generated. The findings revealed that the foot dorsum area and the medial foot region exhibited the lowest PPTs (indicative of high sensitivity). Notably, the foot dorsum area near the toes displayed the highest pain sensitivity (indicative of the lowest PPT), while the plantar area demonstrated comparatively lower pain sensitivity. The heel area exhibited the lowest pain sensitivity. Simultaneously, the study observed that women's feet exhibited lower pain thresholds than men's. In the future, it is imperative to delve deeper into the correlation between short-term pain sensitivity and the daily, long-term exercise state, as well as other physiological data. This exploration will contribute to a more nuanced guide for footwear comfort design.",

To be included, an article should consist of an experimental study investigating the use of collaborative AR for learning in higher education settings. An initial search was conducted on five databases that resulted in a total of 2537 articles, of which 20 were finalized for this review. The main findings suggest that AR-enabled collaborative learning benefits students’ overall learning outcomes and provides a positive collaboration experience in higher education settings. Further research is needed to determine the interaction elements, collaboration mechanisms, and information representation through AR that would potentially enhance student learning outcomes. This article concludes by discussing the implications of these findings, identifying challenges and strategies for developing effective collaborative AR-enabled learning content.",

    "abstract": "Improving fatigue management is critical to the occupational safety of professional drivers. We aimed to identify the factors that facilitated or hindered the implementation of digital sleep coaching in bus companies and to explore bus drivers’ experiences with it. Two bus companies implemented coaching for bus drivers. Using a mixed methods design, we collected data through two workshops (n = 30 and n = 27) attended by key personnel from the organisations and through questionnaires to the drivers (n = 30). Implementation was facilitated by, for example, the flexible participation and multichannel information of coaching, and hindered by restrictions on social support due to the COVID-19 pandemic, and lack of interest and inspiring examples. On average, the drivers rated the appropriateness and the feasibility of coaching as good. However, further development could lead to wider dissemination. It would also be important to involve the key people in the organisations and stakeholders more in supporting the implementation.",

    "doi": "10.1016/j.apergo.2024.104365",
    "abstract": "Call-center-based telephone triage is an example of a complex sociotechnical system relying on successful interactions between patients, callers, and the integration of many digital technologies. Digital technologies such as computer decision support systems are used to standardize triage outcomes with little consideration of how these unique healthcare systems adapt to maintain functionality in response to real-world operating challenges. Using structured observations of call handlers in two call centers and guided by usability heuristics and the concept of ‘workarounds’, this paper aims to investigate the effects of technology design on workflow and system adaptations. Opportunities for improvement are highlighted, particularly, assessment prompts, and updating software to reflect dynamic real-world situations. Interactions between system components, especially technological and organizational processes affected workflow, making adaptations at the individual and organizational levels necessary to ensure callers could be triaged safely. System designers could consider these findings to improve systems and procedures during challenging periods.",

    "abstract": "The operational environment of complex sociotechnical systems is inherently uncertain, demanding constant coordination restructuring to adapt to dynamic situational demands. However, coordination changes in the Human Factors and Ergonomics Field have primarily been studied using static methods, overlooking moment-by-moment adjustments. In the current study, we address coordination restructuring by using THEME, a digital analytical tool capable of visualising and exploring coordination restructuring from a multi-layered perspective. We examine restructuring in coordination patterns during NASA's Apollo 13 Mission, revealing significant shifts from stable, long-duration ‘coordination hubs' in routine operations to shorter-duration patterns during a crisis situation. Additionally, the results highlight the importance of flexible switching between reciprocal and one-directed coordination, along with enhanced role distribution. This study underscores how exploring temporality-sensitive phenomena like coordination through digital technologies such as THEME, advances our understanding of incident analysis and resilient performance within complex systems.",

    "doi": "10.1016/j.apergo.2024.104363",
    "abstract": "Prior research has demonstrated experience with a forecasting algorithm decreases reliance behaviors (i.e., the action of relying on the algorithm). However, the influence of model experience on reliance intentions (i.e., an intention or willingness to rely on the algorithm) has not been explored. Additionally, other factors such as self-confidence and domain knowledge are posited to influence algorithm reliance. The objective of this research was to examine how experience with a statistical model, task domain (used car sales, college grade point average (GPA), GitHub pull requests), and self-confidence influence reliance intentions, reliance behaviors, and perceived accuracy of one's own estimates and the model's estimates. Participants (N = 347) were recruited online and completed a forecasting task. Results indicate that there was a statistically significant effect of self-confidence and task domain on reliance intentions, reliance behaviors, and perceived accuracy. However, unlike previous findings, model experience did not significantly influence reliance behavior, nor did it lead to significant changes in reliance intentions or perceived accuracy of oneself or the model. Our data suggest that factors such as task domain and self-confidence influence algorithm use more so than model experience. Individual differences and situational factors should be considered important aspects that influence forecasters' decisions to rely on predictions from a model or to instead use their own estimates, which can lead to sub-optimal performance.",

Twenty paramedics performed a floor to stretcher lift, lateral transfer, and confined space extrication care-as-usual and with lift assist devices. Use of a lift assist reduced low back muscle activity during floor to stretcher and confined space tasks by 34–47%. Paramedics perceived exertion decreased from ‘somewhat hard’ to ‘light’ or ‘very light’ when using an assistive device. Paramedics noted that ease of use, patient comfort, task time, patient acuity, among other considerations would influence use decisions. Lift assist devices were efficacious at reducing low back muscle activity and perceived exertion during floor to stretcher and patient extrication tasks.",

    "abstract": "As automated vehicles require human drivers to resume control in critical situations, predicting driver takeover behaviour could be beneficial for safe transitions of control. While previous research has explored predicting takeover behaviour in relation to driver state and traits, little work has examined the predictive value of manual driving style. We hypothesised that drivers’ behaviour during manual driving is predictive of their takeover behaviour when resuming control from an automated vehicle. We assessed 38 drivers with varying experience in a high-fidelity driving simulator. After completing manual driving sessions to assess their driving style, participants performed an automated driving task, typically on a subsequent date. Measures of driving style from manual driving sessions, including headway and lane change speed, were found to be predictive of takeover behaviour. The level of driving experience was associated with the behavioural measures, but correlations between measures of manual driving style and takeover behaviour remained after controlling for driver experience. Our findings demonstrate that how drivers reclaim control from their automated vehicle is not an isolated phenomenon but is associated with manual driving behaviour and driving experience. Strategies to improve takeover safety and comfort could be based on driving style measures, for example by the automated vehicle adapting its behaviour to match a driver’s driving style.",

This study proposes a new WBF monitoring technique by applying the Critical Power (CP) model, a bioenergetic model, with a wrist-worn heart rate sensor. The authors modified the CP model to calculate WBF from the percentage of heart rate reserve (%HRR) and generated a personalized model via WBF perception surveys. Data were collected for two days from 33 workers at four construction sites. The results showed that the proposed technique can monitor field workers’ perceived WBF with a mean absolute error of 12.8% and Spearman correlation coefficient of 0.83. This study, therefore, demonstrates the viability of wearable WBF monitoring on construction sites to support programs aimed at improving workplace safety and productivity.",

The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of implemented activities on targeted health behaviors. Methods Data from four organizations in a cluster randomized controlled trial, including 173 employees, were used. Linear multilevel analyses or generalized estimating equations were conducted to assess within- and between-condition differences for physical activity (PA) and nutrition. Results No between-condition differences were apparent for both health behaviors. Within the PA intervention condition, moderate PA increased and light PA decreased. Within the control condition the odds to consume more sugary drinks was lower. Conclusion Implemented activities did not affect the targeted health behaviors, although moderate PA increased within the PA intervention condition. Small sample sizes and implementation of minimal, irregular activities may underly the absence of effect. Future research should address this.",

Across five pre-registered experiments they found evidence of suboptimal aided performance, with AFRS-assisted individuals consistently failing to reach the level of performance the AFRS achieved alone. The current study reanalyses these data (Carragher and Hancock, 2023), to benchmark automation-aided performance against a series of statistical models of collaborative decision making, spanning a range of efficiency levels. Analyses using a Bayesian hierarchical signal detection model revealed that collaborative performance was highly inefficient, falling closest to the most suboptimal models of automation dependence tested. This pattern of results generalises previous reports of suboptimal human-automation interaction across a range of visual search, target detection, sensory discrimination, and numeric estimation decision-making tasks. The current study is the first to provide benchmarks of automation-aided performance in the one-to-one face matching task.",

    "abstract": "Purpose We investigated the influence of passive arm-support exoskeleton (ASE) with different levels of torque (50, 75, and 100%) on upper arm osteokinematics. Methods Twenty participants completed a cyclic overhead drilling task with and without ASE. Task duration, joint angles, and angular acceleration peaks were analyzed during ascent and descent phases of the dominant upper arm. Results Maximum ASE torque was associated with decreased peak acceleration during ascent (32.2%; SD 17.8; p < 0.001) and descent phases (38.8%; SD 17.8; p < 0.001). Task duration remained consistent. Increased torque led to a more flexed (7.2°; SD 5.5; p > 0.001) and internally rotated arm posture (17.6°; SD 12.1; p < 0.001), with minimal changes in arm abduction. Conclusion The small arm accelerations and changes in osteokinematics we observed, support the use of this ASE, even while performing overhead cyclic tasks with the highest level of support.",

    "abstract": "Earplugs’ comfort is primarily evaluated through cost-effective laboratory evaluations, yet these evaluations often inadequately capture the multidimensional comfort aspects due to design limitations that do not replicate real-world conditions. This paper introduces a novel laboratory method for comprehensive assessment of the multidimensional comfort aspects of earplugs, combining questionnaire-based evaluations and objective perceptual tests within virtual industrial sound environments replicating in-situ noise exposure. Objective perceptual results confirm that the sound environment affect participants’ ability to detect alarms in a noisy environment and comprehend speech-in-noise while wearing earplugs. Subjective questionnaire results reveal that the earplugs family has an effect on the primary attributes of the acoustical, physical and functional comfort’s dimension. Participants reported the physical dimension as the most important factor they take into account when evaluating earplugs’ comfort. The functional dimension was considered the second most important factor by the participants, followed by the psychological dimension, and the acoustical dimension.",

    "abstract": "Augmented reality (AR) environments are emerging as prominent user interfaces and gathering significant attention. However, the associated physical strain on the users presents a considerable challenge. Within this background, this study explores the impact of movement distance (MD) and target-to-user distance (TTU) on the physical load during drag-and-drop (DND) tasks in an AR environment. To address this objective, a user experiment was conducted utilizing a 5× 5 within-subject design with MD (16, 32, 48, 64, and 80 cm) and TTU (40, 80, 120, 160, and 200 cm) as the variables. Physical load was assessed using normalized electromyography (NEMG) (%MVC) indicators of the upper extremity muscles and the physical item of NASA-Task load index (TLX). The results revealed significant variations in the physical load based on MD and TTU. Specifically, both the NEMG and subjective physical workload values increased with increasing MD. Moreover, NEMG increased with decreasing TTU, whereas the subjective physical workload scores increased with increasing TTU. Interaction effects of MD and TTU on NEMG were also significantly observed. These findings suggest that considering the MD and TTU when developing content for interacting with AR objects in AR environments could potentially alleviate user load.",

    "abstract": "The purpose of this study was to identify if workplace interventions, (i.e., mindfulness classes and monetary incentives for gym attendance), influenced workers’ physical activity. Office-based participants were randomized into one of four intervention assignments: 1) CONTROL (no interventions) (n = 40), 2) MINDFULNESS (n = 33), 3) GYM INCENTIVE (n = 41), or 4) BOTH mindfulness and gym incentive (n = 31). Activity-tracker and self-reported metabolic expenditure and step counts were gathered between January 2020 and December 2020 whereas the eight-week long interventions were provided between January and March 2020, when the impact of COVID-19 pandemic started. While physical activity decreased during the follow-up months, percent changes of physical activity at 1-, 2-, and 9-month follow-ups compared to baseline show no significant differences between or across the four intervention assignments (p > 0.05). These results suggest that the intervention assignments had no effect on physical activity from baseline. The lack of effectiveness of these interventions on participant physical activity could be attributed to the influence of the COVID-19 pandemic, and any effects of the interventions could not outweigh the effects of the pandemic.",

    "abstract": "Stress impacts driving-related cognitive functions like attention and decision-making, and may arise in automated vehicles due to non-driving tasks. Unobtrusive relaxation techniques are needed to regulate stress without distracting from driving. Tactile wearables have shown efficacy in stress regulation through respiratory guidance, but individual variations may affect their efficacy. This study assessed slow-breathing tactile guidance under different stress levels on 85 participants. Physiological, behavioral and subjective data were collected. The influence of individual variations (e.g., driving habits and behavior, personality) using logistic regression analysis was explored. Participants could follow the guidance and adjust breathing while driving, but subjective efficacy depended on individual variations linked to different efficiency in using the technique, in relation with its attentional cost. An influence of factors linked to the evaluation of context criticality was also found. The results suggest that considering individual and contextual variations is crucial in designing and using such techniques in demanding driving contexts. In this line some design recommendations and insights for further studies are provided.",

    "abstract": "Limb amputation can lead to significant functional challenges in daily activities, prompting amputees to use prosthetic devices (PDs). However, the cognitive demands of PDs and usability issues have resulted in user rejections. This study aimed to create a Human Performance Model for Upper-Limb Prosthetic Devices (HPM-UP). The model used formulations of learnability, error rate, memory load, efficiency, and satisfaction to assess usability. The model was validated in an experiment with 30 healthy participants using a bypass prosthetic device. Findings indicated that the HPM-UP successfully predicted the usability of prosthetic devices, aligning with human subject data. This research proposes a quantitative approach to predict upper limb prosthetic device usability by quantifying each dimension and computationally connecting them. The model, available on Github and executable with Rstudio, could enable clinicians to assess and analyze the human performance of various commercial prostheses, aiding in recommending optimal devices for patients.",

However, research examining how train drivers perceive the impacts of acute stressors is limited. This study investigated train driver perceptions regarding performance impacts of stressful events and potential strategies for reducing negative impacts. 71 Australian train drivers were presented with three stressful event scenarios via an online survey and asked to rate the impacts on driving performance. Results showed that participants perceived that stress would enhance performance, but that impacts differed depending on the event type. The findings suggest that train drivers may not be subjectively aware of negative impacts of acute stress, which has important practical implications for risk management following an incident. Qualitative results revealed the most frequently reported stress impact related to cognition. Practical implications and future research directions to prevent and manage stressful event exposure are discussed.",

Thus, this study explored the areas for improvement in boot design for the development of form-fitting and yet comfortable boots focusing on two different boot designs, prototype all-hazards tactical boots (lace-up) and rubber boots (slip-on). Findings indicated that the boot design should address participants’ concerns with the material choices of boots, specifically with bulkiness, weight, and flexibility. Our findings provide insights into boot material and design choices to improve protective boots for first responders.",

    "abstract": "Many physically straining occupations involve lifting movements over the full-vertical range of motion, which over time may lead to the development of musculoskeletal injuries. To address this, occupational exoskeletons can be designed to provide meaningful support to the back and shoulders during lifting movements. This paper introduces the main functional design features of the OmniSuit, a novel passive occupational exoskeleton. We present the technical and biomechanical considerations for the expected support level, as well as an evaluation of the physiological benefit and usability of the exoskeleton in a sample of 31 healthy volunteers performing physically demanding tasks in a laboratory setting. The OmniSuit exoskeleton significantly reduced Deltoid, Trapezius and Erector Spinae muscle activity between 4.1%MVC and 15.7%MVC when lifting a 2.5kg weight above shoulder level (p<0.001), corresponding to a reduction of up to 49.1% compared to without exoskeleton. A position-dependent reduction of Erector Spinae muscle activity was observed (p<0.001), with reductions ranging between 4.6%MVC and 14.0%MVC during leaning and squatting, corresponding to a reduction up to 41.5% compared to without exoskeleton. The measured muscular support and the predicted support torque based on the biomechanical model were found to show a similar profile for those phases of the movement which are most straining to the shoulder and back muscles. Participants reported experiencing good device usability and minimal discomfort (<1/10) in the shoulder and back during task execution with exoskeleton support. These first results validate that the considered biomechanical model helped design an ergonomic and efficient exoskeleton, and confirm the potential of such wearable assistive devices to provide support over multiple joints during physically demanding tasks.",

    "abstract": "Fit and accommodation are critical design goals for a body armor system to maximize Soldiers’ protection, comfort, mobility, and performance. The aim of this study is to assess fit and accommodation of body armor plates for the US Army. A virtual fit assessment technique, developed, validated, and deployed by NASA for spacesuit design, was adopted for this work. Specifically, 3D manikins of the Soldier population were overlaid virtually with geometrically similar surrogates of the armor plates. Trained subject matter experts with the US Army and NASA manually assessed the fit of the armor plates to manikins using a computer visualization tool and selected the appropriate plate size and position. A prediction model was built from the assessment data to predict the plate size from an arbitrary body shape and the resultant patterns of body-to-plate contact were quantified. The outcome indicated a unique trend of the plate sizes covarying with anthropometry. More pronouncedly, when the overlap between the body tissue and armor plate was quantified, female Soldiers are likely to experience a 25 times larger body-to-plate contact volume and 6.5 times larger contact depth than males on average, due to sex-based anthropometric differences. Overall, the prediction model and contact patterns provided key metrics for virtual body armor fit assessments, of which the locations, patterns, and magnitudes can help to improve sizing and fit of body armor systems, as previously demonstrated for NASA spacesuit design.",

    "abstract": "We investigated the effect of two dynamic seat cushions on postural shift, trunk muscle activation and spinal discomfort. In this repeated-measures study, 30 healthy office workers were randomly assigned to a sequence of three conditions: sitting on a dynamic seat cushion-A, cushion-B and control (no seat cushion). The two dynamic seat cushions had different inflation levels. Participants typed a standard text for an hour and were monitored for postural shift by using a seat pressure mat, transversus abdominis/internal oblique and lumbar multifidus muscles activity by using surface EMG, spinal discomfort by using Borg's CR-10 scale. Two-way repeated ANOVAs showed no statistically significant interaction effects between condition and time on postural shift and muscle activation. Post hoc Bonferroni tests showed that postural shifts and lumbar multifidus activation during sitting on cushion-A were significantly higher (p < 0.01) than in the control and cushion-B conditions. Both cushions reduced spinal discomfort, compared to the control condition (p < 0.05).",

    "abstract": "This research sought to evaluate the thermal zones of the upper body and firefighter personal protective equipment (PPE) immediately following uncompensable heat stress (0.03 °C increase/min). We hypothesized that the frontal portion of the head and the inside of the firefighter helmet would be the hottest as measured by infrared thermography. This hypothesis was due to previous research demonstrating that the head accounts for ∼8–10% of the body surface area, but it accounts for ∼20% of the overall body heat dissipation during moderate exercise. Twenty participants performed a 21-min graded treadmill exercise protocol (Altered Modified Naughton) in an environmental chamber (35 °C, 50 % humidity) in firefighter PPE. The body areas analyzed were the frontal area of the head, chest, abdomen, arm, neck, upper back, and lower back. The areas of the PPE that were analyzed were the inside of the helmet and the jacket. The hottest areas of the body post-exercise were the frontal area of the head (mean: 37.3 ± 0.4 °C), chest (mean: 37.5 ± 0.3 °C), and upper back (mean: 37.3 ± 0.4 °C). The coldest area of the upper body was the abdomen (mean: 36.1 ± 0.4 °C). The peak temperature of the inside of the helmet increased (p < 0.001) by 9.8 °C from 27.7 ± 1.6 °C to 37.4 ± 0.7 °C, and the inside of the jacket increased (p < 0.001) by 7.3 °C from 29.2 ± 1.7 °C to 36.5 ± 0.4 °C. The results of this study are relevant for cooling strategies for firefighters.",

    "doi": "10.1016/j.apergo.2024.104338",
    "abstract": "In a previous scoping review, eight categories of interventions in individual work practice were defined. The aim of the present study is to evaluate the relevance and completeness of these eight categories and to increase the clarity of the nomenclature and definitions of each category. An international expert consultation has been carried out for this purpose. Thirty-eight experts from 13 countries participated. Data collection was conducted using a survey design comprising structured questions. Consensus was reached if 75% of the experts answered ‘Strongly agree’ or ‘Agree’ on a 5-point Likert scale. For the topic ‘Relevance’, there was consensus for six of the eight categories (range 78%–86%), the exceptions were the categories: ‘Exercising’ (72%) and ‘Professional manners' (64%). With regard to the topic ‘Nomenclature’, consensus was reached for six categories and for the topic ‘Definition’ this was five categories. The present definitions have been improved based on the expert recommendations. With respect to the topic ‘Completeness’: although a limited number of suggestions were given, this did not lead to one or more categories being added to the existing eight categories. The final ‘Nomenclature’ for the categories is: ‘Variation’, ‘Professional behaviour’, ‘Motoric skills’, ‘Vocational working techniques’, ‘Physical workplace’, ‘Physical training’, ‘Assistive devices and tools’ and ‘Task content and task organisation’. This expert consultation has provided a solid basis for endorsing the categorisation of interventions in IWP and is an important step in building a framework to develop and evaluate interventions in IWP.",

An anonymous questionnaire was provided to 200 UK Armed Forces personnel deployed to four locations on Operation TORAL in Afghanistan between September and October 2019. This is the first User feedback survey assessing the VIRTUS helmet in an operational environment. Users were measured to ascertain the fit of their helmet and asked to rate perceived helmet mass and comfort using a 5-point Likert scale. Users were also asked whether the VIRTUS helmet was better than previous helmets and about their use of the nape protection. The VIRTUS helmet was perceived to be an improvement over previously issued UK combat helmets in terms of both comfort and mass.",

    "abstract": "This study characterizes, for the first time, the lives of U.S. Navy submariners engaged in normal, sea-based operations while following a circadian-aligned 24-h watchstanding schedule. Fifty-eight submarine crewmembers provided objective (actigraphy) and subjective (questionnaires) sleep data, and information about mood and lifestyle behaviors during 30 days underway. Projected performance scores and estimated circadian phase times were also calculated from actigraphy-based sleep/wake data. Submariners’ objective (6.62 ± 0.94 h; mean ± SD) and subjective (5.90 ± 1.38 h) daily sleep quantities while underway were largely comparable to the sleep reportedly received by Sailors across other Navy platforms and watchstanding schedules. Additionally, submariners' actigraphy-predicted circadian phases shifted progressively toward better alignment with watchstanding schedules across time. Nevertheless, subjective sleep quality was low, submariners engaged in unfavorable lifestyle behaviors (lack of regular meals and exercise), and participants reported decreased mood at the completion of their underway time. Recommendations for countermeasure development are provided.",

    "abstract": "Aim The study aims to evaluate the impact of exposure to a highly realistic virtual facility tour prior to the on-site visit on patients and their parent/care partner's self-reported anxiety and physiological measures on the day of the procedure. Background Preoperative anxiety impacts pediatric surgical outcomes; therefore, it is important for healthcare providers to address and manage preoperative anxiety in pediatric patients to promote better outcomes and overall wellbeing. Providing patients with a preview of the care setting before the actual procedure can be highly beneficial in mitigating preoperative anxiety. Methodology In this pilot randomized experimental study, sixteen patient-care partner dyads scheduled to undergo a gastrointestinal procedure either received a virtual tour identical to the places experienced on the day of the procedure (experimental group) or received no virtual tour (control group). Self-reported measures of anxiety were collected from participants before and on the day of the procedure. Physiological measures of heart rate variability and skin conductance were collected on the day of the procedure from both groups. Results There were no significant differences between the self-reported and physiological measures of anxiety between the child groups. However, parents in the control group reported lower levels of anxiety and demonstrated lower levels of stress based on their physiological measures. Conclusion Exposure to virtual facility tours days before the surgery was not helpful in positively impacting the psychological measures related to preoperative anxiety levels for the participants.",

Motion sickness incidence and motion sickness dose value thresholds exist, but are defined for specific environments, such as naval, or offered merely as optional criteria for ship performance metrics. The presented work communicates a novel means of developing seasickness diagnostic criteria during ship operation, based on observations from shipboard measurement systems and seafarers using an innovative platform. The innovative platform provides personalised seasickness criteria that are accessible during ship operation to estimate the probable level of seasickness on board. Results are compared to that from a traditional method of data acquisition and analyses, post operation, revealing a similar trend in diagnostic threshold magnitudes (13–85 m/s1.5) that can be applicable to voyages with different durations (0.5–6 hr) considering desired levels of seasickness (10–50 %). The seasickness criteria are envisioned to be pertinent for the prediction of probable seasickness levels based on sea state forecasts and ship motion estimation.",

    "doi": "10.1016/j.apergo.2024.104311",
    "abstract": "To optimise soldier protection within body armour systems, knowledge of the boundaries of essential thoraco-abdominal organs is necessary to inform coverage requirements. However, existing methods of organ boundary identification are costly and time consuming, limiting widespread adoption for use on soldier populations. The aim of this study was to evaluate a novel method of using 3D organ models to identify essential organ boundaries from low dose planar X-rays and 3D external surface scans of the human torso. The results revealed that, while possible to reconstruct 3D organs using template 3D organ models placed over X-ray images, the boundary data (relating to the size and position of each organ) obtained from the reconstructed organs differed significantly from MRI organ data. The magnitude of difference varied between organs. The most accurate anatomical boundaries were the left, right, and inferior boundaries of the heart, and lateral boundaries for the liver and spleen. Visual inspection of the data demonstrated that 11 of 18 organ models were successfully integrated within the 3D space of the participant's surface scan. These results suggest that, if this method is further refined and evaluated, it has potential to be used as a tool for estimating body armour coverage requirements.",

The current study compared pelvis and lumbar spine kinematics, pain, and work productivity, in traditional and dynamic sitting. Sixteen participants completed three 20-min blocks of computer work and activity guided tasks in a traditional office chair or backless and multiaxial rotating seat pan while kinematics were measured from accelerometers on the low back. Pain ratings were recorded on a visual analogue scale every 10 min. Similar pelvis and lumbar kinematics emerged when performing computer work in traditional and dynamic sitting. Pelvis and lumbar sagittal and frontal plane shifts and fidgets were largest for dynamic sitting in the activity guided tasks. Buttocks pain was higher in dynamic sitting, but low back pain and work productivity were unaffected. Dynamic sitting increased spine movement during activity guided tasks, without negatively impacting lumbar kinematics, low back pain, or productivity during seated computer work.",

    "abstract": "The increased adoption of digital systems in the maritime domain has led to concerns about cyber resilience, especially in the wake of increasingly disruptive cyber-attacks. This has seen vessel operators increasingly adopt Maritime Security Operation Centers (M-SOCs), an action in line with one of the cyber resilience engineering techniques known as adaptive response, whose purpose is to optimize the ability to respond promptly to attacks. This research sought to investigate the domain-specific human factors that influence the adaptive response capabilities of M-SOC analysts to vessel cyber threats. Through collecting interview data and subsequent thematic analysis informed by grounded theory, cyber awareness of both crew onboard and vessel operators emerged as a pressing domain-specific challenge impacting M-SOC analysts' adaptive response. The key takeaway from this study is that vessel operators remain pivotal in supporting the M-SOC analysts’ adaptive response processes through resource allocation towards operational technology (OT) monitoring and cyber personnel staffing onboard the vessels.",

    "abstract": "The 5.0 industry promotes collaborative robots (cobots). This research studies the impacts of cobot collaboration using an experimental setup. 120 participants realized a simple and a complex assembly task. 50% collaborated with another human (H/H) and 50% with a cobot (H/C). The workload and the acceptability of the cobotic collaboration were measured. Working with a cobot decreases the effect of the task complexity on the human workload and on the output quality. However, it increases the time completion and the number of gestures (while decreasing their frequency). The H/C couples have a higher chance of success but they take more time and more gestures to realize the task. The results of this research could help developers and stakeholders to understand the impacts of implementing a cobot in production chains.",

    "abstract": "The role of task priority on task selection in multi-task management is unclear based on prior work, leading to a common finding of ‘priority neglect’. However, properties such as urgency and conflict may influence whether operators weigh priority in their decision. We examined the role of instructed task prioritization, bolstered by more urgent and conflicting conditions, on how operators select among emergent, concurrent tasks when multitasking. Using the Multi-Attribute Task Battery (MATB) multitasking platform we tested both an auditory communications task and a manual tracking task as the priority tasks. Results showed that instructed priority significantly increased target task selection under the conflicting task conditions for both tasks. Urgency itself may modulate whether instructions to prioritize affect task selection choices when multitasking, and therefore counter to prior results instructions may yet be useful for helping operators select a higher priority task under conflict, a generalizable effect to be further explored.",

Nine healthy participants (4 male and 5 female) completed simulated lifting-lowering tasks in various conditions and with two different hand loads (2.3 and 6.8 kg). We compared three sEMG signal feature sets (i.e., time, frequency, and a combination of both domains) and three ML classifiers (i.e., Random Forest, Support Vector Machine, and Logistic Regression). Both Random Forest and Support Vector Machine models, using either time-domain or time- and frequency-domain features, yielded the best performance in detecting lifts, with respective accuracies of 79.2% (start) and 86.7% (end). Similarly, both ML models yielded the highest accuracy (80.9%) in classifying the two hand loads, regardless of the sEMG features used, emphasizing the potential of sEMG armbands for assessing exposure and risks in occupational lifting tasks.",

    "abstract": "Background Load carriage imposes high physical stresses on the human body, increasing the risk of injuries. This study assessed the effectiveness of a passive military exoskeleton in off-loading the weight placed on the body during heavy load carriage under static standing and dynamic walking conditions. Methods Eight full-time regular personnel of the Singapore Armed Forces enrolled in the study. Static loading tests included nine trials of 10-s quiet standing while carrying different loads (0–55 kg) with and without the exoskeleton. For dynamic loading, participants walked on a treadmill on flat, inclined, and declined surfaces while carrying two different loads (25 kg, 35 kg) with and without the exoskeleton. In-shoe normal ground reaction forces (GRF) were recorded during quiet standing and treadmill walking. Differences in total force with and without the exoskeleton during static loading were compared using Wilcoxon one-sample signed ranked tests against zero (no weight off-load) as a reference. Statistical parametric mapping test was used to compare the walking in-shoe GRF-time series with and without exoskeleton use for each load and surface condition. Results Exoskeleton use was effective in off-loading loads of 2.3–13.5 kg during static quiet standing but the response varied substantially across loads and among the participants. Statistical analysis revealed no meaningful differences in the walking in-shoe GRF with and without exoskeleton use. The results were largely consistent across flat, inclined, and declined surfaces, and both 25-kg and 35-kg loads. Conclusions The passive military exoskeleton was effective in off-loading some load from the human body during static quiet standing but not dynamic walking on flat and sloped surfaces. The varied response across loads and participants calls for better design and fitting of the military exoskeleton to individual users.",

    "abstract": "Artificial lighting, which profits from the non-visual effects of light, is a potentially promising solution to support residents’ psychophysiological health and performance at specific times of the day in enclosed environments. However, few studies have investigated the non-visual effects of daytime correlated colour temperature (CCT) and its exposure timing on human alertness, cognition, and mood. However, the neural mechanisms underlying these effects are largely unknown. The current study evaluated the effects of daytime CCT and its exposure timing on markers of subjective experience, cognitive performance, and cerebral activity in a simulated enclosed environment. Forty-two participants participated a single-blind laboratory study with a 4 within (CCT: 4000 K vs. 6500 K vs. 8500 K vs. 12,000 K) × 2 between (exposure timing: morning vs. afternoon) mixed design. The results showed time of the day dependent benefits of the daytime CCT on subjective experience, vigilant attention, response inhibition, working memory, emotional perception, and risk decisions. The results of the electroencephalogram (EEG) revealed that lower-frequency EEG bands, including theta, alpha, and alpha-theta, were quite sensitive to daytime CCT intervention, which provides a valuable reference for trying to establish the underlying mechanisms that support the performance-enhancement effects of exposure to CCT in the daytime. However, the results revealed no consistent intervention pattern across these measurements. Therefore, future studies should consider personalised optimisation of daytime CCT for different cognitive demands.",

    "abstract": "Non-Technical Skills (NTS) of medical teams are currently measured using subjective and resource-intensive ratings given by experts. This study explores if objective NTS assessment approaches with eye-tracking and audio sensors can measure teamwork and communication skills in surgery. Eight surgeons participated in a simulated two-phase surgical scenario developed to assess their NTS. Sensor-based audio, eye tracking and video data were collected and analyzed along with rating from the NOTSS scale. Different levels of communication were detected by the sensor data during the two phases of the simulated surgery. Sensor data detected leadership qualities among surgeons based on speech metrics, and eye tracking offered additional evidence about gaze patterns related to NTS. This objective approach to NTS measurement captured differences in communication in greater detail as opposed to a single collective rating obtained using current assessment tools.",

    "abstract": "There is evidence that existing standards for signal timing do not provide enough time for many pedestrians to safely cross intersections. Yet, current methods for studying this problem rely on inefficient manual observations. The objective of this work was to determine if the YOLOv4 and Deep SORT computer vision algorithms have the potential to be incorporated into automated measurement systems to measure and compare pedestrian walking speeds at one-stage and two-stage street crossings captured in birds-eye-view video. Walking speed was estimated for 1018 pedestrians at single-stage (591 pedestrians) and two-stage (427 pedestrians) street crossings. Pedestrians in the one-stage crossing were found to be significantly slower than pedestrians who crossed the two-stage crossing in one signal (1.19 ± 0.50 vs. 1.31 ± 0.49 m/s, p < 0.001). This proof of principle study demonstrated that the YOLOv4 and Deep SORT approaches are promising for estimating pedestrian walking speed.",

The objective of this study was to develop a machine learning algorithm (MLA) that can estimate cognitive workload of LEOs while performing secondary tasks in a patrol vehicle. A ride-along study was conducted with 24 nLEOs. Participants performed their normal patrol operations while their physiological responses such as heartrate, eye movement, and galvanic skin response were recorded using unobtrusive devices. Findings suggested that the random forest algorithm could predict cognitive workload with relatively high accuracy (>70%) given that it was entirely reliant on physiological signals. The developed MLA can be used to develop adaptive in-vehicle technology based on real-time estimation of cognitive workload, which can reduce the risk of MVCs in police operations.",

Such tools are needed to operationalize and translate resilience in healthcare and, thus, advance the field of patient safety by learning from both positive and negative events and outcomes. The purpose of this study is to describe the developmental process of one such tool to enable operationalization of resilient healthcare and aid future tool development. The development process featured a complex, multi-step, design through involvement of a range of different stakeholders. A combination of publicly available platforms, cross-sectional knowledge, step-by step instructions and a learning tool that engages participants in collaborative practice to facilitate discussions across stakeholders and system levels is proposed as a means to create awareness of when and what contributes to resilient performance is fundamental to understanding and improving healthcare system resilience.",

    "abstract": "There is evidence that existing standards for signal timing do not provide enough time for many pedestrians to safely cross intersections. Yet, current methods for studying this problem rely on inefficient manual observations. The objective of this work was to determine if the YOLOv4 and Deep SORT computer vision algorithms have the potential to be incorporated into automated measurement systems to measure and compare pedestrian walking speeds at one-stage and two-stage street crossings captured in birds-eye-view video. Walking speed was estimated for 1018 pedestrians at single-stage (591 pedestrians) and two-stage (427 pedestrians) street crossings. Pedestrians in the one-stage crossing were found to be significantly slower than pedestrians who crossed the two-stage crossing in one signal (1.19 ± 0.50 vs. 1.31 ± 0.49 m/s, p < 0.001). This proof of principle study demonstrated that the YOLOv4 and Deep SORT approaches are promising for estimating pedestrian walking speed.",

Human Factors (HF) play a critical role in providing high-quality and acceptable DH solutions. Consultation with designers is crucial for reflecting on and improving current DH design practices. Objectives We investigated the general DH design processes, challenges, and corresponding strategies that can improve the digital patient experience (PEx). Methods A semi-structured interview study with 24 design professionals. All audio recordings were transcribed, deidentified, grammatically corrected, and imported into ATLAS.ti for data analysis. Three coders participated in data coding following the thematic analysis approach. Results We identified eight DH design stages and grouped them into four phases: preparation, problem-thinking, problem-solving, and implementation. The analysis presented twelve design challenges associated with contextual, practical, managerial, and commercial aspects that can hinder the design process. We identified eight common strategies used by respondents to tackle these challenges. Conclusions We propose a Digital Health Design (DHD) framework to improve the digital PEx. It provides an overview of design deliverables, activities, stakeholders, challenges, and corresponding strategies for each design stage.",

    "abstract": "Virtual reality (VR) has gained significant attention as a technology that provides immersive experiences similar to the real world. In order for a VR system to be accepted, usability needs to be guaranteed. Accordingly, VR-related researchers are continuing their efforts to improve VR systems by conducting usability evaluations. However, existing studies have limitations in that they cannot comprehensively evaluate the detailed properties of VR systems by using questionnaires developed for general product usability evaluation or focusing only on some usability aspects of VR systems. This suggests it may be difficult to fully capture usability issues in a VR system, and that it is necessary to develop a usability evaluation tool that reflects the specific characteristics of the VR system. Therefore, this study develops and proposes the Virtual Reality System Usability Questionnaire (VRSUQ). In the development of the questionnaire, items were structured based on a literature review and discussions with experts. To account for the diverse characteristics of VR systems, the validity of the questionnaire was verified through both exploratory and confirmatory factor analysis, utilizing data obtained from three distinct experimental studies that employed different VR systems. In addition, by comparing the results of VRSUQ with the results from the System Usability Scale, which is widely used for perceived usability evaluation, alternative possibilities for using VRSUQ are presented. Further testing on various VR platforms is needed to ensure the reliability and validity of VRSUQ, and as results from using VRSUQ are accumulated, it is expected to be widely used as a more powerful and robust VR-specific perceived usability evaluation tool.",

    "abstract": "This study investigated the roles of phishing knowledge, cue utilization, and decision styles in contributing to phishing email detection. Participants (N = 145) completed an online email sorting task, and measures of phishing knowledge, email decision styles, cue utilization, and email security awareness. Cue utilization was the only factor that uniquely predicted the capacity to discriminate phishing from genuine emails. Phishing knowledge was associated with greater phishing detection and a bias towards classifying all emails as phishing. A preference for intuitive decision making predicted lower detection of phishing emails, driven by a greater tendency to classify emails as genuine. These findings support the proposition that cue utilization is a distinct cognitive process that enables expert performance. The outcomes indicate that, in addition to increasing phishing knowledge and developing safe behavioral patterns, anti-phishing training needs to provide opportunities for trainees to develop meaningful cue associations.",

This study investigates the effects of different floor inclinations, on handle push or pull force production. Participants performed maximal isometric contraction tasks requiring to exert a maximal voluntary force either by pulling or pushing a handle, at different floor inclinations from −30° to +30° about the transverse and longitudinal axes. Maximal hand force and Ground Reaction Forces about both feet were recorded. The results revealed non-equivalent variations in hand and feet responses as a function of inclination angle. Specifically, there was a significant reduction in handle push-pull force production, up to 70% (p < 0.001) for extreme inclinations, around both axes. This study provides critical data for design engineers, highlighting the challenge of production forces at steep angles.",

    "abstract": "The coronavirus pandemic shocked the already overwhelmed global healthcare system, challenging its preparedness to deal with mass fatalities. Our research examines the safety issues faced by healthcare workers when handling dead (deceased) bodies, highlighting the need for better strategies in the event of mass fatalities. Healthcare providers involved in dead body handling during the COVID-19 pandemic in the U.S. were eligible to participate in our study. Using a web-based survey, we analyzed responses of 206 participants across 43 U.S. states. We used the Systems Engineering Initiative for Patient Safety (SEIPS) framework to deduce themes from participants’ open-ended responses. The study showed how routine tasks become extraordinarily challenging during pandemic due to increased workload, emotional stress, and resource constraints. Tasks such as lifting and transferring bodies, underscored physical and emotional toll on workers. The mental strain induced by mass fatalities and the complexities of communicating with families and peers were also prominent, adding to the overall burden on healthcare workers. The participants emphasized the importance of specialized training, policy refinements, and improvements in its implementation. In conclusion, our study contributes to understanding the complexities of dead body handling during a pandemic. It underscores the need for emergency response planning and systemic changes in healthcare policies and practices to ensure the safety and well-being of healthcare workers engaged in these critical tasks.",

    "abstract": "Weaning patients from ventilation in intensive care units (ICU) is a complex task. There is a growing desire to build decision-support tools to help clinicians during this process, especially those employing Artificial Intelligence (AI). However, tools built for this purpose should fit within and ideally improve the current work environment, to ensure they can successfully integrate into clinical practice. To do so, it is important to identify areas where decision-support tools may aid clinicians, and associated design requirements for such tools. This study analysed the work context surrounding the weaning process from mechanical ventilation in ICU environments, via cognitive task and work domain analyses. In doing so, both what cognitive processes clinicians perform during weaning, and the constraints and affordances of the work environment itself, were described. This study found a number of weaning process tasks where decision-support tools may prove beneficial, and from these a set of contextual design requirements were created. This work benefits researchers interested in creating human-centred decision-support tools for mechanical ventilation that are sensitive to the wider work system.",

    "abstract": "Exercise induced performance fatigue has been shown to impair many aspects of fine motor function in the distal upper limb. However, most fatiguing protocols do not reflect the conditions experienced with computer use. The purpose of this study was to determine how a prolonged, low-force mouse clicking fatigue protocol impacts performance fatigue of the distal upper limb for gamers and non-gamers. Participants completed a total of 1 h of mouse clicking at 5 clicks per second. Muscle fatigue and performance were intermittently assessed. RMS amplitude increased for the forearm flexors throughout the fatigue protocol. Accuracy decreased following the first bout of clicking and returned to baseline values after 40-min. EDC and ECU displayed the greatest muscle activity while aiming, producing 11.4% and 12.9% of MVC, respectively. These findings indicate that mouse clicking may not result in performance fatigue, however, high levels of extensor activity may explain common injuries among gamers.",

    "abstract": "The movements of syringes and medications during an anesthetic case have yet to be systematically documented. We examine how syringes and medication move through the anesthesia work area during a case. We conducted a video-based observational study of 14 laparoscopic surgeries. We defined 'syringe events' as when syringe was picked up and moved. Medications were administered to the patient in only 48 (23.6%) of the 203 medication or syringe events. On average, 14.5 syringe movements occurred in each case. We estimate approximately 4.2 syringe movements for each medication administration. When a medication was administered to the patient (either through the IV pump or the patient port), it was picked up from one of 8 locations in the work area. Our study suggests that the syringe storage locations vary and include irregular locations (e.g., patient bed or provider's pockets). Our study contributes to understanding the complexity in the anesthesia work practices.",

This study investigates the relationship between EMS operational metrics and perceived workload, measured through the NASA task load index (TLX) survey. We paired crew member survey responses with the operational metrics based on dispatch data. Linear regression was used to evaluate the influence of each metric on perceived workload. Logistic regression was used to identify values of workload indicating a fair day's work. We found that the overall CV (p < 0.001, R 2 = 0.32 ) and UHU (p < 0.001, R 2 = 0.22 ) explained less variability in perceived workload than a priority (P)-stratified CV (p < 0.001, R 2 = 0.41 ). However, we found no clear fair day's workload threshold. We conclude that a priority-stratified CV is a better workload surrogate than a CV and UHU.",

    "doi": "10.1016/j.apergo.2024.104264",
    "abstract": "Whole-body vibration (WBV) is prevalent in labour-related activities and can have adverse effects on the health and performance of the individuals exposed. However, evidence regarding the extent to which human functionality is affected following occupational WBV exposure has not been collated. The current systematic review sought to synthesize existing literature and assess the strength and direction of evidence regarding the acute after-effects of occupational WBV exposure on cognition, visual function, postural stability, and motor control. We conducted a comprehensive search of AMED, CINAHL, MEDLINE, PubMED, Psychology and Behavioural Sciences Collection, SPORTDiscus, APA PsychInfo, Cochrane Library, EMBASE, HMIC, Global Health, ProQuest Central, Scopus, Web of Science, and the US National Technical Information Service on April 26, 2023. Studies that quantified vibration exposure and measured acute changes in cognition, visual function, postural stability, and motor control from baseline to post-vibration were considered without date restriction. Out of the 2663 studies identified, 32 were eligible for inclusion. Based on the Risk of Bias in Non-Randomized Studies of Exposure (ROBINS-E) tool, the studies demonstrated low (66%), moderate (25%) and high risk of bias (9%). The findings indicate that after exposure to WBV, postural stability either deteriorates or remains unchanged. Inconsistent effects of WBV on cognition were reported, while visual function and motor control showed no pronounced changes following WBV. This might be attributed to assessment limitations such as learning effects in neuropsychological and motor tasks, and non-functional measures of vision employed. There was a lack of consistency in the characterization of vibration exposure and the assessment of associated effects on functional performance. Current evidence is therefore insufficient to provide definitive guidance for updating occupational health and safety regulations regarding WBV. However, this review highlights the potential for WBV to jeopardize post-exposure human performance and, consequently, safety. The completion of the review was supported by a UKRI EPSRC training grant. The review has been registered on PROSPERO (ref CRD42023391075).",

    "abstract": "Humans working in modern work systems are increasingly required to supervise task automation. We examined whether manual aircraft conflict detection skill predicted participants’ ability to respond to conflict detection automation failures in simulated air traffic control. In a conflict discrimination task (to assess manual skill), participants determined whether pairs of aircraft were in conflict or not by judging their relative-arrival time at common intersection points. Then in a simulated air traffic control task, participants supervised automation which either partially or fully detected and resolved conflicts on their behalf. Automation supervision required participants to detect when automation may have failed and effectively intervene. When automation failed, participants who had better manual conflict detection skill were faster and more accurate to intervene. However, a substantial proportion of variance in failure intervention was not explained by manual conflict detection skill, potentially reflecting that future research should consider other cognitive skills underlying automation supervision.",

The aims of this study were to evaluate perceived levels of OHS during two seasons and its perceived consequences on healthcare professionals (HCPs) and to assess the efficacy of heat stress management (HSM) policies. An anonymous online survey was distributed to HCPs working in HCFs in the UK. The survey returned 1014 responses (87% women). Descriptive statistics and content analysis of survey data identified that OHS in HCFs is frequently experienced throughout the year and concerned most HCPs. Over 90% perceived OHS impairs their performance and 20% reported heat-related absenteeism. Awareness of HSM policies was poor and 73% deemed them not adequate. To help reduce the financial loss and impact on staff performance, health and well-being and patient safety, it is recommended that revisions and widespread dissemination of HSM policies are made.",

    "abstract": "Previous studies on Human Factors and Ergonomics (HFE) have primarily examined the impact of Work-From-Home (WFH) on worker health and well-being, yet little research has examined the optimal implementation process of WFH programs. Work systems perspective suggests that organizational policies, leadership, and psychological factors collectively influence the success of organizational change efforts. Our study explored the roles of managerial/supervisory, psychological, and organizational policy factors in facilitating the relationship between employees' HFE awareness and their acceptance and satisfaction with the WFH arrangement. Using data from 3195 knowledge workers in the US who use computers as their primary work tool and have worked from home at least one day in the past 30 days, we employed structural equation modeling to test our hypotheses. Transformational HFE leadership and employees' general self-efficacy are pivotal in implementing ergonomic WFH arrangements. The combination of employees' HFE awareness, transformational HFE leadership, and adequate levels of self-efficacy may foster positive process outcomes (e.g., readiness for WFH arrangement, workspace design satisfaction) in WFH arrangements. Efforts that are coordinated across organizational levels determine the effectiveness of organizational change.",

A total of 140 participants participated in a summative usability evaluation of an anaphylactic shock auto-injector device under either a high-fidelity condition or a condition acceptable from the manufacturer's perspective, lower-fidelity condition. The numbers of errors detected in each condition were compared by applying descriptive statistics and logistic and Poisson multivariate regressions. We found that the level of fidelity did not influence the overall number of use errors detected but did influence the detection of certain use errors. To optimize the test environment and increase the detection of use errors, each environmental feature's role in the test task should first be examined.",

    "abstract": "With the era of automated driving approaching, designing an effective auditory takeover request (TOR) is critical to ensure automated driving safety. The present study investigated the effects of speech-based (speech and spearcon) and non-speech-based (earcon and auditory icon) TORs on takeover performance and subjective preferences. The potential impact of the non-driving-related task (NDRT) modality on auditory TORs was considered. Thirty-two participants were recruited in the present study and assigned to two groups, with one group performing the visual N-back task and another performing the auditory N-back task during automated driving. They were required to complete four simulated driving blocks corresponding to four auditory TOR types. The earcon TOR was found to be the most suitable for alerting drivers to return to the control loop because of its advantageous takeover time, lane change time, and minimum time to collision. Although participants preferred the speech TOR, it led to relatively poor takeover performance. In addition, the auditory NDRT was found to have a detrimental impact on auditory TORs. When drivers were engaged in the auditory NDRT, the takeover time and lane change time advantages of earcon TORs no longer existed. These findings highlight the importance of considering the influence of auditory NDRTs when designing an auditory takeover interface. The present study also has some practical implications for researchers and designers when designing an auditory takeover system in automated vehicles.",

    "doi": "10.1016/j.apergo.2024.104290",
    "abstract": "The growing use of digital technologies (DTs) has a myriad of implications to socio-technical systems, which are not yet fully recognised. This paper investigates the contributions and drawbacks of DTs to resilient performance (RP), an aspect that so far has received less attention in comparison to others such as efficiency. To this end, a survey questionnaire was applied to 79 academics and practitioners linked to resilience engineering. Data analysis involved descriptive statistics and a thematic analysis of the open-text responses to the survey. Mixed impacts were identified, with 10 themes related to contributions and 16 to drawbacks. Regarding the contributions, the results highlighted the use of DTs for monitoring and anticipating system performance. Machine learning seems to be the most promising approach for this purpose. A key drawback is the need for developing new skills across the workforce so that they can make sense of the outputs of DTs and are aware of their strengths and weaknesses. The human role is expected to remain crucial for RP, which makes the current coordination difficulties with DTs even more important to address. A research agenda composed of five topics is proposed, encompassing description, prescription, and assessment. The agenda emphasizes the need for mapping the attributes or functionalities of DTs onto resilience concepts, models, and frameworks.",

A total of 14 new articles were added with the majority focusing on rotator cuff syndrome (RCS) with seven studies. Nine articles reported psychosocial exposures in addition to physical exposures. The strongest evidence was found for the association between elevation, repetition, force and vibration and the occurrence of SIS and tendinosis/tendonitis. Evidence also suggests that psychosocial exposures are associated with the occurrence of RCS and tendinosis/tendonitis. Other findings were inconsistent which prevents drawing strong conclusions.",

As seat belts become more prevalent on large school buses, characterizing the capabilities of children to operate the unlatching mechanism of a seat belt is crucial to ensure the post-crash safety of young passengers. This study evaluated the strength capabilities of children and their abilities to unlatch a school bus seat belt when a school bus is in both the upright and rolled-over orientations. Push force exertions on a seat belt buckle push button were measured and compared to the seat belt assembly release force requirements specified in Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard (FMVSS) No. 209. Results of the study suggested that children do not have the strength to exert the maximum force of 133 N to release a seat belt assembly as specified in FMVSS No. 209; however, most children could unlatch a typical school bus seat belt assembly in the upright and rolled-over orientations.",

This review provides significant implications for the ergonomic design of CMS display layouts, including some potential design opportunities and future research directions.",

This study investigated how airport security screeners employ problem solving during x-ray screening, and how strategies change with experience. Thirty-nine professional security screeners were observed performing x-ray screening in the field at an Australian International Airport. Video and eye-tracking data were collected and analysed to explore activity phases and problem-solving strategies. Less-experienced screeners performed more problem solving and preferred problem-solving strategies that rely on visual examination without decision support or that defer decision making, compared to more-experienced screeners, who performed efficient and independent strategies. Findings also show that screeners need more time to develop problem-solving skills than visual scanning skills. Screeners would benefit from problem-solving support tools and intensified training and mentorship within the first six months of experience to advance problem-solving competencies.",

We address this question from the perspective of cognitive systems, which, in this case, includes considerations of AI and process transparency, resilience, division of labor, and worker skills. We draw from a case study on glass tempering that includes a machine-vision-based quality control system and an advanced automation process control system. Based on task analysis and background literature, we develop the concept of hybrid intelligence that implies balanced AI transparency that supports upskilling and resilience. So-called fragmented intelligence, in turn, may result from the combination of the complexity of advanced automation along with the complexity of the process physics that places critical emphasis on expert knowledge. This combination can result in the so-called “double black box effect”, given that designing for understandability for the line workers might not be feasible: expert networks are needed for resilience.",

    "abstract": "Due to the trend of replacing dual displays with ultrawide (UW) curved displays, we used a mixed methods analysis to investigate the user experience with UW curved displays. We conducted an experimental laboratory study that quantified user self-selected positions for three displays – 24 in. flat panel, and 34 in. and 40 in. UW curved displays. Participants were first provided with a familiarization protocol, and they then positioned the display. The self-selected UW display viewing distances were within current recommendations; however, viewing distance increased with display size, potentially challenging small work surface depths and may have been in response to feeling “overwhelmed” by larger displays. Head twist range of motion increased with display width. While all displays were within recommendations, participants commented that less head twisting was a factor in choosing the 34 in. over the 40 in. display. Practitioners should assess potential workstation limitations and the potential impact on neck twist angles when installing ultrawide displays.",

    "abstract": "With proper compliance, safe patient handling and mobility (SPHM) programs reduce musculoskeletal disorders (MSDs). To better understand individual, environmental, and organizational factors associated with both the adoption of SPHM and prevalence of MSDs, a nationwide online survey was administered. 973 healthcare workers (HCWs) completed the survey, for which 59.6% reported past work-related MSDs or pain. Among those with pain or injury, 33.3% changed roles, 79.7% worked while injured, and only 30.9% reported workers’ compensation claims. Less than half of HCWs agreed that SPHM equipment is readily available, and most considered manually handling patients weighing over 91 kg acceptable. Equipment availability, ceiling lift availability, supervisor encouragement, and annual training were associated with increased use of SPHM equipment. Availability of SPHM equipment reduced the likelihood of injured nurses changing roles. Despite overall agreement that SPHM programs are beneficial, common clinical practice remains insufficient to adequately protect HCWs from risk of injury.",

    "abstract": "Background and Purpose Industrial environments present unique challenges in ensuring worker safety and optimizing productivity. The emergence of smart wearable technologies such as smart insoles has provided new opportunities to address these challenges through accurate unobtrusive monitoring and analysis of workers' activities and physical parameters. This systematic review aims to analyze the utilization of smart wearable insoles in industrial environments, focusing on their applications, employed analysis methods, and potential future directions. Methods A comprehensive review was conducted, involving the analysis of 27 papers that utilized smart wearable insoles in industrial settings. The reviewed articles were evaluated to determine the trends in application and methodology, explore the implementation of smart insoles across different industries, and identify the prevalent machine learning models and analyzed activities in the relevant literature. Results The majority of the reviewed articles (67%) primarily focused on human activity recognition and gesture estimation using smart wearable insoles, aiming to enhance safety and productivity in industrial settings. Furthermore, 10% of the studies focused on fatigue identification, 10% on slip, trip, and fall hazard detection, and 13% on biomechanical analyses of workers' body joint loads. The construction industry accounted for approximately 60% of the studies conducted in industrial settings using smart insoles. The most prevalent machine learning models utilized in these studies were neural networks (48%), support vector machines (33%), k-nearest neighbors (30%), decision trees (26%), and random forests (15%). These models achieved median accuracies of 95%, 96%, 91%, 92%, and 95%, respectively. Among the analyzed activities, walking, bending with/without lifting/lowering a load, and carrying a load were the most frequently considered, with frequencies of 10, 10, and 7 out of the 27 studies, respectively. Conclusion The findings of this systematic review demonstrate the growing interest in implementing smart wearable insoles in industrial environments to enhance safety and productivity. However, the effectiveness of these systems is dependent on factors such as accuracy, reliability, and generalizability of the models. The review highlights the need for further research to address these challenges and to explore the potential of these systems for use in other industrial applications such as manufacturing. Overall, this systematic review provides valuable insights for researchers, practitioners, and policymakers in the field of occupational health and safety.",

    "abstract": "Objective The objective of our work was to assess the impact of flight conditions by aircraft type on the workload estimated using NASA-Task Load Index (NASA-TLX). Background Learning about subjective workload is important for assessing the impact of a pilot's work environment on their performance in the cockpit. This is an important element of flight safety and includes the prevention of aviation accidents. Methods The study included 146 military pilots that fly the following aircrafts: flying fast-jet (21), fixed-wing (24), and rotary-wing (101). The NASA-TLX questionnaire was used to assess workload and pilots were asked to determine the level of workload resulting from flying under the following conditions: daytime flight (VFR), night-vision flight performed under Night Visual Flight Rules (NVFR), and night-vision flight using night-vision goggles (NVGs). Results The highest level of workload was consistently attributed to flights performed under NVG conditions. NVFR conditions were rated as the most burdensome, while VFR conditions were rated as the least burdensome. Fast-jet pilots rated their mental performance and effort workload as significantly higher than pilots of other aircrafts. Conclusion Pilots’ perceived workload is influenced by both flight conditions and the type of aircraft they fly. Workload knowledge is important for flight safety and should be taken into account during training and flight-task planning. Application The results of our study can be useful both in flight training and in work on the effectiveness of the human-machine interface. Awareness of one's own limitations due to the work environment can help improve flight safety.",

    "abstract": "During the COVID-19 pandemic, telework best practices decreased in importance compared to the need for social distancing. It is important that ergonomics assessments for home office workstations are equally as effective as assessment for traditional offices to maintain teleworker wellbeing. The purpose of this case study is to compare a remote, picture-based, home office assessment to a traditional, in-person, office assessment for employees of one Canadian University. Intraclass Correlation Coefficients (ICCs) and Bland-Altman Analyses (BAAs) revealed that the two methods provide repeatable results, with good agreement. Feedback from the participants suggested that picture-based assessments were as effective as in-person assessments; but that picture-based assessments could be improved with video conferencing to discuss findings and ask follow-up questions. Participants found value in remote assessments and, while they preferred in-person assessments, picture-based assessments are suitable when needed as they allow for many assessments to be completed without violating social distancing restrictions.",

    "abstract": "This study investigates the impact of advanced driver-assistance systems on drivers' mental workload. Using a combination of physiological signals including ECG, EMG, EDA, EEG (af4 and fc6 channels from the theta band), and eye diameter data, this study aims to predict and categorize drivers’ mental workload into low, adequate, and high levels. Data were collected from five different driving situations with varying cognitive demands. A functional linear regression model was employed for prediction, and the accuracy rate was calculated. Among the 31 tested combinations of physiological variables, 9 combinations achieved the highest accuracy result of 90%. These results highlight the potential benefits of utilizing raw physiological signal data and employing functional data analysis methods to understand and assess driver mental workload. The findings of this study have implications for the design and improvement of driver-assistance systems to optimize safety and performance.",

In this context, the application of eye-tracking-equipped Virtual Reality (VR) devices to support an evaluation on the effect of greenery elements indoors on individuals’ efficiency and engagement is limited. A new approach to investigate visual attention, distraction, cognitive load and performance in this field is carried out via a pilot-study comparing three virtual office layouts (Indoor Green, Outdoor Green and Non-Biophilic). 63 participants completed cognitive tasks and surveys while measuring gaze behaviour. Sense of presence, immersivity and cybersickness results supported the ecological validity of VR. Visual attention was positively influenced by the proximity of users to the greenery element, while visual distraction from tasks was negatively influenced by the dimension of the greenery. In the presence of greenery elements, lower cognitive loads and more efficient information searching, resulting in improved performance, were also highlighted.",

    "abstract": "Previous research has shown there are particular patterns of license plate designs that are easier to recall. Missouri license plate patterns (AB1-C2D) somewhat diverge from what research suggests works best for recall. The current study examined whether incorporating color into license plates would improve recall, and also whether awareness or explanation of license plate formats would affect recall accuracy. Across two experiments, participants viewed license plate stimuli with and without color and attempted to recall them. The hypothesis was that incorporating color would improve recall, but the hypothesis was not supported. Results also did not show that prior exposure or explanation of formats affected accuracy. Future research should explore additional ways to improve license plate designs that would be easy to implement. Such improvements to license plate design would be useful because efforts to improve the public's awareness of formats would be expensive and likely ineffective.",

    "doi": "10.1016/j.apergo.2024.104278",
    "abstract": "Commonly used risk indexes, such as the NIOSH Lifting Index, do not capture the effect of exoskeletons. This makes it difficult for Health and Safety professionals to rigorously assess the benefit of such devices. The community requires a simple method to assess the effectiveness of back-support exoskeleton's (BSE) in possibly reducing ergonomic risk. The method introduced in this work is termed “Equivalent Weight” (EqW) and it proposes an interpretation of the effect built on the benefit delivered through reduced activation of the erector spinae (ES). This manifests itself as an apparent reduction of the lifted load perceived by the wearer. This work presents a pilot study where a practical application of the EqW method is used to assess the ergonomic risk in manual material handling (MMH) when using a back support exoskeleton (StreamEXO). The results are assessed by combining observational measurements from on-site testing with five different workers and quantitative measures of the muscle activity reduction achieved during laboratory evaluation with ten workers. These results will show that when lifting, lowering, and carrying a 19 kg load the StreamEXO can reduce risk by up to two levels (from “high” to “low”) in the target sub-tasks. The Lifting index (LI) was reduced up to 64% when examining specific sub-tasks and the worker's movement conduction.",

    "abstract": "Resilient system performance in high-stakes settings, which includes the ability to monitor, respond, anticipate, and learn, can be enhanced for trainees through simulation of realistic scenarios enhanced by augmented reality. Active learning strategies can enhance simulation-based training, particularly the mental model articulation principle where students are prompted to anticipate what will happen next and the reflection principle where students self-assess their performance compared to a gold standard expert model. In this paper, we compared simulation-based training for trauma care with and without active learning strategies during pauses in the simulated action for progressively deteriorating patients. The training was conducted online and real-time without a facilitator, with 42 medical students viewing training materials and then immediately taking an online quiz for three types of trauma cases: hemorrhage, airway obstruction, and tension pneumothorax. Participants were randomly assigned to either the experimental or control condition in a between-subjects design. We compared performance in the control and experimental conditions based on: A) the proportion of cues correctly recognized, B) the proportion of accurate diagnoses, C) the proportion of appropriate treatment interventions, and D) verbal briefing quality on a 1–5 scale. We found that the training intervention increased recognition of subtle cues critical for accurate diagnosis and appropriate treatment interventions; the training did not improve the accuracy of diagnoses or the quality of the verbal briefing. We conclude that incorporating active learning strategies in simulation-based training improved foundational capabilities in detecting subtle cues and intervening to rescue deteriorating patients that can increase the readiness for trainees to contribute to resilient system performance in the high-stakes setting of emergency care in hospitals.",

    "abstract": "Burnout is a prevalent issue among healthcare providers affecting up to 54% of physicians and 35% of nurses. Patient Aligned Care Teams (PACT) is a team-based primary care delivery model designed to assure the delivery of high-quality care while improving clinicians' well-being. Limited studies evaluated the relationship between work environment variables and PACT members' burnout and the relationship between PACT members' burnout and patient-centered care. This cross-sectional study is based on the 2018 Veterans Health Administration (VHA) national web-based PACT survey. Burnout was measured using a single-item question that was validated in previous studies. Descriptive statistics and logistic regression were used to analyze the data. Fifty-one percent of primary care providers and 40.12% of nurses reported high burnout. PACT members with a work environment characterized by high-quality team interaction, leadership support, and psychological safety experienced lower levels of burnout. PACT members' burnout explained 6% of the variance in PACT members' ability to deliver patient-centered care. Burnout among PACT members is attributed to multiple personal and occupational variables. This study identified modifiable work environment variables that can be used to inform burnout interventions.",

    "abstract": "The objective of the current study was to explore the utilization of the decision tree (DT) algorithm to model posture-discomfort relationships at the individual level. The DT algorithm has the advantage that it makes no assumptions about the distribution of data, is robust in representing non-linear data with noise, and produces white-box models that are interpretable. Individual-level modelling is essential for examining individual-specific postural discomfort perception processes and understanding the inter-individual variability. It also has practical applications, including the development of individual-specific digital human models and more precise and informative population accommodation analysis. Individual-specific DT models were generated using postural discomfort rating data for various seated upper body postures to predict discomfort based on postural and task variables. The individual-specific DT models accurately predicted postural discomfort and revealed large inter-individual variability in the modelling results. DT modelling is expected to greatly facilitate investigating the human discomfort perception process.",

    "abstract": "Understanding driver behaviors in varied traffic scenarios is critical to the design of safe and efficient roadways and traffic control device. This research presents an analysis of driver cognitive workload, situation awareness (SA) and performance for three different scenarios, including a standard intersection and contraflow grade-separated intersections (C-GSI) and quadrant GSI (Q-GSI) with lane assignment sign manipulations. The study used a simulator-based driving experiment with application of the NASA Task Load Index and Situation Awareness Global Assessment Technique to assess the influence of the scenarios on driver behavioral responses. The findings reveal challenges for drivers navigating the C-GSI, characterized by diminished SA and elevated workload. These states were associated with behaviors such as delayed lane changes, missed opportunities for appropriate lane changes, heightened acceleration behavior within deceleration segments, and frequent speeding. In contrast, while drivers in the Q-GSI scenario faced elevated workloads, their SA remained steady, largely due to lane-specific signs facilitating early lane changes. Although the Q-GSI led to increased speed variability and slight increases in deceleration, the use of supplementary speed signage revealed a promising alternative to the S-intersection. Correlation analysis highlighted a significant relationship between mental workload and acceleration responses, indicating that increased acceleration was associated with higher mental workload. In addition, a significant negative correlation between driver perceived performance and absolute lane deviations indicated that drivers with higher self-assessed performance were more accurate in lane-keeping. The study underscores the need for GSIs and signage designs that support driver SA, manage cognitive workload to improve driver performance and increase road safety.",

    "abstract": "Decision aids are commonly used in tactical decision-making environments to help humans integrate base-rate and multi-cue information. However, it is important that users appropriately trust and rely on aids. Decision aids can be presented in many ways, but the literature lacks clarity over the conditions surrounding their effectiveness. This research aims to determine whether a numerical or graphical aid more effectively supports human performance, and explores the relationships between aid presentation, trust, and workload. Participants (N = 30) completed a signal-identification task that required integration of readings from a set of three dynamic gauges. Participants experienced three conditions: unaided, using a numerical aid, and using a graphical aid. The aids combined gauge and base-rate information in a statistically-optimal fashion. Participants also indicated how much they trusted the system and how hard they worked during the task. Analyses explored the impact of aid condition on sensitivity, response bias, response time, trust, and workload. Both the numerical and graphical aids produced significant increases in sensitivity and trust, and significant decreases in workload in comparison to the unaided condition. The difference in response time between the graphical and unaided conditions approached significance, with participants responding faster using the graphical aid without decrements in sensitivity. Significant interactions between aid and signal type indicated that both aided conditions promoted faster responding to non-hostile signals, with larger mean differences in the graphical aid condition. Practically, graphical aids in which suggestions are more salient to users may promote faster responding in tactical environments, with negligible cost of accuracy.",

    "abstract": "Building maintenance encompasses multiple tightly inter-connected agents (e.g., technicians, occupants, supervisors, and equipment). Variable working conditions and limited resources may affect the safety and sustainability of the activities. Although recent studies have explored how complex systems can perform resilient behavior in facing the complexity of everyday activities, the factors that effectively contribute to resilient performance are still paired with limited empirical evidence. We studied the performance of the maintenance team during sudden breakdowns of air-conditioning devices in a large university campus, using the Functional Resonance Analysis Method (FRAM). A FRAM diagram containing 30 functions was organized including six macro-cognitive functions (expertise, sensemaking, communication, coordination, collaboration, and adaptation/improvisation), examining their role in anticipating, and responding to emergencies, and eight functional units that are directly impacted by disturbances were analyzed in more detail. Results indicate that macro-cognitive functions can greatly impact the functionality of the maintenance team in pursuit of their goals. Moreover, we noted those macro-cognitive functions here analyzed depend on each other to produce resilient performance.",

    "abstract": "Mobile robotic telepresence systems require that information about the environment, the task, and the robot be presented to a remotely located user (operator) who controls the robot for a specific task. In this study, two interaction modes, proactive and reactive, that differ in the way the user receives information from the robot, were compared in an experimental system simulating a healthcare setting. The users controlled a mobile telepresence robot that delivered and received items (medication, food, or drink), and also obtained metrics (vital signs) from a simulated patient while the users performed a secondary healthcare-related task (they compiled health records which were displayed to them on the screen and answered related questions). The effect of the two interaction modes on overall performance and user perception was evaluated through a within-participant study design conducted with 50 participants belonging to two different types of populations (with and without a technological background). Efficiency, effectiveness, understanding, satisfaction, and situation awareness were defined as the dependent variables measured both objectively and subjectively. The proactive mode increased user performance, and understanding of the system and reduced the workload compared to the reactive mode. However, several of the users valued the option of increased user control experienced in the reactive mode. We, therefore, proposed design suggestions to highlight some of the benefits of factoring the reactive mode into the design as a hybrid mode.",

    "doi": "10.1016/j.apergo.2023.104201",
    "abstract": "Given the evolution of human body dimensions, the increasing diversity within the law enforcement workforce, the growing risks of assault faced by law enforcement officers (LEOs), and the absence of a national standard for body armor sizing, there is a critical need to explore LEO body size classification. This exploration will facilitate the development of an armor sizing structure that adequately accommodates the current LEO population. This study aimed to address this need by developing a LEO body armor sizing scheme and creating a sizing chart/app. Additionally, a plan was devised for a series of 'sizing vests' that would enhance LEO armor accommodation and facilitate fit assessment. Torso anthropometric data pertaining to body armor sizing were collected from 756 male and 218 female LEOs across different regions of the United States. Based on the collected data, a nine-size system for male LEOs and an eight-size scheme for female LEOs were suggested. Furthermore, a sizing chart/app was proposed to enable LEOs to swiftly identify an armor size that is most likely to fit an individual, considering a few anthropometric characteristics known to LEOs. To supplement the sizing chart/app, a series of 'sizing vests' were recommended. These vests would provide LEOs with a physical means to assess and determine the best-fitting armor size, offering an alternative to relying solely on the sizing chart/app. We recommend that armor manufacturers adopt these new sizing systems and create prototypes of armor that can be evaluated within this sizing structure. This evaluation process will facilitate improved fit and enhanced protection for LEOs.",

    "abstract": "Despite robot-assisted surgery (RAS) becoming increasingly common, little is known about the impact of the underlying work organization on the stress levels of members of the operating room (OR) team. To this end, assessing whether RAS may impact work-related stress, identifying associated stress factors and surveying relevant measurement methods seems critical. Using three databases (Scopus, Medline, Google Scholar), a systematic review was conducted leading to the analysis of 20 articles. Results regarding OR team stress levels and measurement methods were heterogeneous, which could be explained by differing research conditions (i.e., lab. vs. real-life). Relevant stressors such as (in)experience with RAS and quality of team communication were identified. Development of a common, more reliable methodology of stress assessment is required. Research should focus on real-life conditions in order to develop valid and actionable knowledge. Surgical teams would greatly benefit from discussing RAS-related stressors and developing team-specific strategies to handle them.",

    "abstract": "Increasing chair recline during seated computer work may reduce the load placed on the upper trapezius (UT), a common location of pain for those with idiopathic chronic neck pain. This study determined the effect of increasing chair recline on UT stiffness and muscle activity during computer work in people with and without idiopathic chronic neck pain. Surface electromyography and ultrasound shear wave elastography were collected from three subdivisions of the UT in 15 individuals with idiopathic chronic neck pain and 15 sex-matched healthy controls. Participants sat in a standardized computer-work setup while chair recline (0°, 25°, 45°) and head and neck position (self-selected, neutral, flexed) were systematically adjusted and maintained for 2.5-min intervals. Repeated-measures ANOVAs were completed for each sex, muscle, and data type, with group (chronic neck pain, control), chair recline (0°,25°,45°), head and neck position (self-selected, flexed, neutral), and side of collected data (dominant, non-dominant) as fixed factors. Men with idiopathic chronic neck pain demonstrated greater UT stiffness in the cranial subdivision when compared to healthy men. Additionally, the 25° and 45° recline levels increased the stiffness of men's dominant UT compared to men's non-dominant UT. Women's UT was more affected by head and neck position, and a neutral head and neck position resulted in lower UT activation, but higher UT stiffness for the cranial subdivision and midway between C-7 and the acromion process. Overall, our findings suggest that the commonly suggested neutral position may not be a beneficial prompt when positioning someone during seated computer work.",

The noise levels simulated to mimic acoustic conditions during car driving ranged from 35 dB(A) to 65 dB(A). The conclusions drawn were as follows: (1) Noise levels directly influenced subjective annoyance levels, with annoyance linearly increasing as noise levels escalated; (2) Both attention and short-term memory task reaction times of drivers were significantly influenced by noise types. Compared to traffic noise and white noise, drivers' cognitive efficiency was lower under entertainment noise. (3) Performance in complex cognitive tasks was more susceptible to noise levels compared to simple cognitive tasks; (4) Experimentally, it was found that drivers exhibited the highest cognitive efficiency in cognitive tasks when the environmental noise level was 55 dB(A), as opposed to noise levels of 35 dB(A), 45 dB(A), and 65 dB(A).",

    "abstract": "Within the framework of Industry 5.0, human factors are essential for enhancing the work conditions and well-being of operators interacting with even more advanced and smart manufacturing systems and machines and increasing production performances. Nevertheless, cognitive ergonomics is often underestimated when implementing advanced industrial human-robot interaction. Thus, this work aims to systematically update, develop, and validate guidelines to assist non-experts in the early stages of the design of anthropocentric and collaborative assembly applications by focusing on the main features that have positively influenced workers' cognitive responses. A methodology for structured development has been proposed. The draft guidelines have been created starting from the outcomes of a systematic and extended screening of the scientific literature. Preliminary validation has been carried out with the help of researchers working in the field. Inputs on comprehensibility and relevance have been gathered to enhance the guidelines. Lastly, a survey was used to examine in depth how international experts in different branches can interpret such guidelines. In total, 108 responders were asked to qualitatively and quantitatively evaluate the guideline's comprehensibility and provide general comments or suggestions for each guideline. Based on the survey's results, the guidelines have been validated and some have been reviewed and re-written in their final form. The present work highlights that integrating human factors into the design of collaborative applications can significantly bolster manufacturing operations' resilience through inclusivity and system adaptability by enhancing worker safety, ergonomics, and wellbeing.",

    "abstract": "In healthcare, artificial intelligence (AI) is expected to improve work processes, yet most research focuses on the technical features of AI rather than its real-world clinical implementation. To evaluate the implementation process of an AI-based computer-aided detection system (AI-CAD) for prostate MRI readings, we interviewed German radiologists in a pre-post design. We embedded our findings in the Model of Workflow Integration and the Technology Acceptance Model to analyze workflow effects, facilitators, and barriers. The most prominent barriers were: (i) a time delay in the work process, (ii) additional work steps to be taken, and (iii) an unstable performance of the AI-CAD. Most frequently named facilitators were (i) good self-organization, and (ii) good usability of the software. Our results underline the importance of a holistic approach to AI implementation considering the sociotechnical work system and provide valuable insights into key factors of the successful adoption of AI technologies in work systems.",

    "abstract": "Development of fatigue management solutions is critical to U.S. Navy populations. This study explored the operational feasibility and acceptability of commercial wearable devices (Oura Ring and ReadiBand) in a warship environment with 845 Sailors across five ship cohorts during at-sea operations ranging from 10 to 31 days. Participants were required to wear both devices and check-in daily with research staff. Both devices functioned as designed in the environment and reliably collected sleep-wake data. Over 10,000 person-days at-sea, overall prevalence of Oura and ReadiBand use was 69% and 71%, respectively. Individual use rates were 71 ± 38% of days underway for Oura and 59 ± 34% for ReadiBand. Analysis of individual factors showed increasing device use and less device interference with age, and more men than women found the devices comfortable. This study provides initial support that commercial wearables can contribute to infrastructures for operational fatigue management in naval environments.",

We reviewed previously used questionnaires and extracted 51 important subjective evaluation items from them. We then recruited 251 participants to observe 3D images designed to easily induce sickness or visual fatigue, and we asked them to respond to the 51 items. As a result of exploratory factor analysis, four factors were extracted according to their factor loadings, and the number of items was reduced to 21. Further processing by confirmatory factor analysis led to the selection of 15 items. Comparing mean ratings for each factor before and after item reduction indicated that item reduction did not significantly affect the participant responses. Therefore, the 15-item Visually Induced Symptoms Questionnaire (VISQ), can be used to evaluate VIMS and s3D visual fatigue.",

    "abstract": "Driver fatigue is a major contributor to road accidents. Therefore, driver assistance systems (DAS) that would monitor drivers' states may contribute to road safety. Such monitoring can potentially be achieved with input from ECG indices (e.g., heart rate). We reviewed the empirical literature on responses of cardiac measures to driver fatigue and on detecting fatigue with cardiac indices and classification algorithms. We used meta-analytical methods to explore the pooled effect sizes of different cardiac indices of fatigue, their heterogeneity, and the consistency of their responses across studies. Our large pool of studies (N = 39) allowed us to stratify the results across on-road and simulator studies. We found that despite the large heterogeneity of the effect sizes between the studies, many indices had significant pooled effect sizes across the studies, and more frequently across the on-road studies. We also found that most indices showed consistent responses across both on-road and simulator studies. Regarding the detection accuracy, we found that even on-road classification could have been as accurate as 70% with only 2-min of data. However, we could only find two on-road studies that employed fatigue classification algorithms. Overall, our findings are encouraging with respect to the prospect of using cardiac measures for detecting driver fatigue. Yet, to fully explore this possibility, there is a need for additional on-road studies that would employ a similar set of cardiac indices and detection algorithms, a unified definition of fatigue, and additional levels of fatigue than the two fatigue vs alert states.",

    "abstract": "Backpacks are common devices for carrying external posterior loads. However, relatively little is known about how these external loads affect the ability to recover from balance loss. In this exploratory investigation, 16 young adults (8 female, 8 male) performed forward and backward lean-and-release balance recovery trials, while wearing a backpack that was unloaded or loaded (at 15% of individual body weight). We quantified the effects of backpack loading on balance recovery in terms of maximum recoverable lean angles, center-of-mass kinematics, and temporal-spatial stepping characteristics. Mean values of maximum lean angles were 20° and 9° in response to forward and backward perturbations, respectively. These angles significantly decreased when wearing the additional load for only backward losses of balance. During backward losses of balance, the additional load decreased peak center-of-mass velocity and increased acceleration by ∼10 and 18% respectively, which was accompanied by ∼5% faster stepping responses and steps that were ∼9% longer, 11% higher, and had an ∼10% earlier onset. Thus, wearing a backpack decreases backward balance recovery ability and changes backward recovery stepping characteristics.",

    "abstract": "Postpartum haemorrhage (PPH) is an obstetric emergency causing nearly one-quarter of maternal deaths worldwide, 99% of these in low-resource settings (LRSs). Uterine balloon tamponade (UBT) devices are a non-surgical treatment to stop PPH. In LRSs, low-cost versions of UBT devices are based on the condom balloon tamponade (CBT) technique, but their effectiveness is limited. This paper discusses the experimental study to assess the usability and performance of a medical device, BAMBI, designed as an alternative to current CBT devices. The testing phase involved medical and non-medical personnel and was focused on testing BAMBI's usability and effectiveness compared to a standard CBT solution. We collected measures of the execution time and the procedure outcome. Different training procedures were also compared. Results show a significant preference for the BAMBI device. Besides, medical and non-medical subjects reached comparable outcomes. This aspect is highly relevant in LRSs where the availability of medical personnel could be limited.",

    "abstract": "Upper-limb occupational exoskeletons to support the workers' upper arms are typically designed to provide antigravitational support. Although typical work activities require workers to perform static and dynamic actions, the majority of the studies in literature investigated the effects of upper-limb occupational exoskeletons in static and quasi-static activities, while only a few works focused on dynamic tasks. This article presents a systematic evaluation of the effects of different levels of antigravitational support (from about 60% to 100% of the arm gravitational load) provided by a passive upper-limb occupational exoskeleton on muscles’ activity during repetitive arm movements. The effect of the exoskeleton on muscle activity was evaluated by the comparison of muscle activations with and without the exoskeleton. The average muscle activation was computed considering shoulder full flexion-extension cycles, and sub-movements, namely the arm-lifting (i.e., flexion) and arm-lowering (i.e., extension) movements. Results showed a quasi-linear correlation between antigravitational support and muscle activity reductions, both when considering the full flexion-extension cycle and in the arm-lifting movement (reductions were up to 64 and 61% compared to not wearing the exoskeleton, respectively). When considering the arm-lowering movement, providing antigravitational support close to or higher than 100% of the arm gravitational load led to increased muscle activations of the extensors (up to 127%), suggesting that such an amount of antigravitational support may be not effective for a complete biomechanical load reduction on the shoulder district in dynamic tasks.",

    "abstract": "Slippery surfaces due to oil spills pose a significant risk in various environments, including industrial workplaces, kitchens, garages, and outdoor areas. These situations can lead to accidents and falls, resulting in injuries that range from minor bruises to severe fractures or head trauma. To mitigate such risks, the use of slip resistant footwear plays a crucial role. In this study, we aimed to develop an Artificial Intelligence model capable of classifying footwear as having either high or low slip resistance based on the geometric characteristics and material parameters of their outsoles. Our model was trained on a unique dataset comprising images of 37 indoor work footwear outsoles made of rubber. To evaluate the slip resistant property of the footwear, all samples were tested using a cart-type friction measurement device, and the static and dynamic Coefficient of Frictions (COFs) of each outsole was determined on a glycerol-contaminated surface. Machine learning techniques were implemented, and a classification model was developed to determine high and low slip resistant footwear. Among the various models evaluated, the Support Vector Classifier (SVC) obtained the best results. This model achieved an accuracy of 0.68 ± 0.15 and an F1-score of 0.68 ± 0.20. Our results indicate that the proposed model effectively yet modestly identified outsoles with high and low slip resistance. This model is the first step in developing a model that footwear manufacturers can utilize to enhance product quality and reduce slip and fall incidents.",

    "abstract": "The pupil diameter has been shown to provide insight to a person's experienced cognitive strain. Pupillary light responses, however, make this measure unreliable in uncontrolled settings. Two derived indicators—Index of Cognitive Activity (ICA) and Index of Pupillary Activity (IPA)—aim to ‘eliminate’ lighting influences, changing based only on the perceived cognitive strain. The IPA potentially offers a valuable alternative to the ICA through its fully transparent calculation, which lifts the restrictions to proprietary software and supported eye trackers. The measures are examined and compared based on two experimental studies; (i) as indicators of cognitive strain during mental arithmetic tasks and (ii) under different conditions of computer screen luminance. Results indicate that neither indicator differentiates between the increasing levels of cognitive strain. Differences in screen luminance are reflected in both indicators, although differently between the conditions. Both results contradict the claims of the indicators and further investigations are thus required.",

    "doi": "10.1016/j.apergo.2024.104237",
    "abstract": "The road transport system is a complex sociotechnical system that relies on a number of formal and informal rules of the road to ensure safety and resilience. Interactions between vulnerable road users and drivers often includes informal communication channels that are tightly linked to social norms, user expectations and the environmental context. Automated vehicles have a challenge in being able to communicate and respond to these informal rules of the road, therefore additional technologies are required to better support vulnerable road users. This paper presents the informal rules that cyclists and drivers employ within a cyclist overtake manoeuvre, through qualitative data collected from focus groups and interviews with road users. These informal rules are classified into the key elements of resilience (monitor, detect, anticipate, respond and learn) to understand how they guide the resilient interactions between road users. Using a human factors approach, the Perceptual Cycle Model shows how information is communicated between different road users and created by the situational context. This is then used to inform how automation will alter the communication between cyclists and drivers, and what additional feedback mechanisms will be needed to support the systems resilience. Technologies that can support these feedback mechanisms are proposed as avenues for future development.",

    "doi": "10.1016/j.apergo.2024.104229",
    "abstract": "Driving style has been proposed to be a critical factor in automated driving. However, the role of driving style in the process of taking over during automated driving needs further investigation. The main purpose of this study was to investigate the influence of driving style on takeover performance under the influence of warning system factors. In addition, this study also explored whether the impact of driving style on reaction time varies over time and the role of driving style on a comprehensive takeover quality indicator. Two driving simulation experiments with different takeover request (TOR) designs were conducted. In experiment 1, content warning information was provided in the TOR with different warning stage designs; in experiment 2, countdown warning information was provided in the TOR with different warning stage designs. Sixty-four participants (32 for experiment 1 and 32 for experiment 2) were classified into two groups based on their driving style (i.e., aggressive, or defensive) using the Chinese version of the Multidimensional Driving Style Inventory (the brief MDSI-C). The results suggested that drivers’ driving style had significant effects on takeover performance, but the effects were influenced by warning system designs. Specifically, defensive participants performed better takeover performance, i.e., shorter reaction time and cautious vehicle control behaviors, than aggressive participants in most warning conditions. The content and countdown warning information and warning stage design affected the roles of driving style on takeover performance: 1) compared to the one-stage warning design, the two-stage warning design significantly shortened the reaction time of the participants with different driving styles, 2) compared to the countdown warning information design, the design of content warning information can shorten the reaction time of aggressive participants and lengthen the reaction time of defensive participants in the two-stage warning conditions, and 3) compared to the content warning information design, countdown warning information can improve the safe takeover performance of defensive participants. This study provides a better understanding of the role of driving style on takeover performance, and driving style should be considered when designing warning systems for autonomous vehicles.",

Relevant databases were searched up to January 2020 for cohort studies reporting associations between work-related physical or psychosocial risk factors and the incidence of CTS. Two independent reviewers selected eligible studies, extracted relevant data, and assessed risk of bias (RoB). We identified fourteen articles for inclusion which reported data from nine cohort studies. Eight reported associations between physical exposure and the incidence of CTS and five reported associations between psychosocial exposures and the incidence of CTS. Quality items were generally rated as unclear or low RoB. Work-related physical exposure factors including high levels of repetition, velocity, and a combination of multiple physical exposures were associated with an increased risk of developing CTS. No other consistent associations were observed for physical or psychosocial exposures at work and CTS incidence.",

    "abstract": "Background Exercise is recommended for office workers with neck pain. However, recent reviews evaluated the effectiveness of workplace interventions only. Objectives To evaluate the effect of exercise on pain, disability, and quality of life (QoL) in office workers with chronic neck pain. Design Systematic review with meta-analysis. Methods Electronic databases were searched from inception to April 30, 2022, to identify studies in which participants were adults aged ≥18 years undergoing any form of neck exercises (e.g., strengthening, motor control) or physical activity (e.g., aerobic exercise) performed for a minimum of two-weeks without any other additional treatment besides advice or education. Two reviewers independently screened papers and determined the certainty of the evidence. Results Eight randomised controlled trials met the eligibility criteria. Seven studies reported a significant decrease in Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) scores for neck pain intensity and five studies reported a significant decrease in Neck Disability Index (NDI) scores following strengthening exercises. Only one study assessed the effect of strengthening exercises on QoL and reported no significant effect. All eight included studies had a high risk of bias and the overall certainty of evidence was low. Meta-analyses demonstrated a significant decrease of neck pain intensity and disability for strengthening exercises compared to a control (p < 0.01). Conclusion There is low certainty of evidence that strengthening of the neck, shoulder and scapular musculature is effective at reducing neck pain and disability in office workers. Further research evaluating the effect of exercise on QoL is required.",

    "doi": "10.1016/j.apergo.2024.104244",
    "abstract": "The cognitive load experienced by humans is an important factor affecting their performance. Cognitive overload or underload may result in suboptimal human performance and may compromise safety in emerging human-in-the-loop systems. In driving, cognitive overload, due to various secondary tasks, such as texting, results in driver distraction. On the other hand, cognitive underload may result in fatigue. In automated manufacturing systems, a distracted operator may be prone to muscle injuries. Similar outcomes are possible in many other fields of human performance such as aviation, healthcare, and learning environments. The challenge with such human-centred applications is that the cognitive load is not directly measurable. Only the change in cognitive load is measured indirectly through various physiological, behavioural, performance-based and subjective means. A method to objectively assess the performance of such diverse measures of cognitive load is lacking in the literature. In this paper, a performance metric for the comparison of different measures to determine the cognitive workload is proposed in terms of the signal-to-noise ratio. Using this performance metric, several measures of cognitive load, that fall under the four broad groups were compared on the same scale for their ability to measure changes in cognitive load. Using the proposed metrics, the cognitive load measures were compared based on data collected from 28 participants while they underwent n-back tasks of varying difficulty. The results show that the proposed performance evaluation method can be useful to individually assess different measures of cognitive load.",

    "abstract": "Work Domain Analysis (WDA), the foundational phase in the Cognitive Work Analysis Framework (CWA), provides a platform for understanding and designing complex systems. Though it has been used extensively, there are few applications in healthcare, and model validation for different contexts is not always undertaken. The current study aimed to validate an Emergency Department (ED) WDA across three metropolitan hospitals that differ in the type and nature of services they provide, including the ED in which the original ED WDA was developed. A facilitated workshop was conducted at the first ED and interviews at two subsequent EDs to refine and validate the ED WDA. ED subject matter experts (SMEs) including nurses, doctors, administration, and allied health personnel provided feedback on the model. SME feedback resulted in modifications to the original ED WDA model including combining nodes to reduce duplication and amending five labels for clarity. The resulting WDA provides a valid representation of the EDs found in metropolitan districts within an Australian state and can be used by roles such as frontline ED clinicians, hospital managers, and policy developers to facilitate the design, testing, and sharing of solutions to local and shared problems. The findings also demonstrate the importance of validating WDA models across different contexts.",

    "abstract": "This study assessed the effect of season on cognitive function and psycho-physiological responses during a 14-day swing in mine-service workers. Cognitive function, thermal sensation and comfort, rating of perceived exertion, fatigue, hydration, core temperature and heart rate were assessed throughout a shift, on three separate days over a swing. Working memory and processing efficiency did not differ between seasons (p > 0.05), however counting and recall latencies improved throughout the swing (p < 0.05). Participants reported greater fatigue post-shift compared to pre-shift (p < 0.05). Thermal sensation, thermal comfort, and hydration were significantly elevated in summer compared to winter (p < 0.05). Specifically, workers were significantly/minimally dehydrated in summer/winter (urinary specific gravity = 1.025 ± 0.007/1.018 ± 0.007). Although cognitive function and thermal strain were not impaired in summer compared to winter, it is essential to reinforce worker's knowledge regarding hydration requirements. Additional education and/or incorporating scheduled rest breaks for hydration should be considered to ensure the health and safety of mine workers.",

    "abstract": "There are concerns that Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) could pose an existential threat to humanity; however, as AGI does not yet exist it is difficult to prospectively identify risks and develop requisite controls. We applied the Work Domain Analysis Broken Nodes (WDA-BN) and Event Analysis of Systemic Teamwork-Broken Links (EAST-BL) methods to identify potential risks in a future ‘envisioned world’ AGI-based uncrewed combat aerial vehicle system. The findings suggest five main categories of risk in this context: sub-optimal performance risks, goal alignment risks, super-intelligence risks, over-control risks, and enfeeblement risks. Two of these categories, goal alignment risks and super-intelligence risks, have not previously been encountered or dealt with in conventional safety management systems. Whereas most of the identified sub-optimal performance risks can be managed through existing defence design lifecycle processes, we propose that work is required to develop controls to manage the other risks identified. These include controls on AGI developers, controls within the AGI itself, and broader sociotechnical system controls.",

    "abstract": "Work-related upper extremity disorders (WRUEDs) are highly prevalent and costly. Development of fatigue is thought to be one of the causes of WRUEDs. Perceived fatigue can be assessed with the Borg CR Scale® (Borg CR10). The objective was to validate the Borg CR10 for the evaluation of shoulder perceived fatigue during lifting tasks. Seventy adults in working age performed three rhythmic lifting tasks with two loads (15% and 30% of maximal voluntary contraction). Using generalized repeated-measures ANOVA (Generalized Estimating Equations), statistically significant Task and Load effects (p < 0.001), as well as Task × Load interaction effects (p < 0.0001) were observed on Borg CR10, without any influence of sex. The Borg CR10 is a valid tool to assess shoulder perceived fatigue as it can discriminate between tasks of different difficulty levels in term of complexity, height, and resistance, regardless of sex.",

    "abstract": "Labour shortages and costly operator training are driving the need for digital on-board robotic crane operator support in forestry and construction. This simulator study investigated the effects of sonification (auditory, pitch/loudness) and continuous visual (brightness/size) feedback on aiming movements with a robotic crane for low and high performers. The feedback was designed non-linear and linear. Thirty-six participants controlled a robotic crane bimanually using joysticks across 320 movements. Performance and skill indicators (movement time, accuracy, trajectory, smoothness) as well as satisfaction, and usefulness were assessed. Low-performing participants showed higher movement accuracy, particularly with non-linear pitch feedback compared to visual feedback. High performers exhibited no significant performance improvement in movement time, accuracy, or smoothness. There was no effect of linear or non-linear mapping of the feedback. Additionally, perceived satisfaction was lower with auditory than visual feedback. These results suggest that real-time auditory feedback can enhance operator accuracy whereas acceptance remains challenging.",

    "abstract": "Advances in robotics have contributed to the prevalence of human-robot collaboration (HRC). However, working and interacting with collaborative robots in close proximity can be psychologically stressful. Therefore, understanding the impacts of human-robot interaction (HRI) on mental stress is crucial for enhancing workplace well-being. To this end, this study investigated how the HRI factors – presence, complexity, and modality – affect the psychological stress of workers. We employed both the NASA-Task Load Index for subjective assessment and physiological metrics including galvanic skin responses, electromyography, and heart rate for objective evaluation. An experimental setup was implemented in which human operators worked together with a collaborative robot on Lego assembly tasks, using different interaction paradigms including pressing buttons, showing hand gestures, and giving verbal commands. The results revealed that the introduction of interactions during HRC helped reduce mental stress and that complex interactions resulted in higher mental stress than simple interactions. Meanwhile, using hand gestures led to significantly higher mental stress than pressing buttons and verbal commands. The findings provided practical insights for mitigating mental stress in the workplace and promoting wellness in the era of HRC.",

    "abstract": "This study quantified sex-specific biomechanical adaptations to fatigue in asymmetric lifting. Twenty-one females and fifteen males performed a prolonged asymmetric lifting protocol while upper body, trunk and pelvis kinematics were collected. Features of movement identified with principal component analysis, and peak joint angular velocities and moments were calculated. Sex-specific kinematic adaptations to fatigue included females adopting a ‘stoop-like’ lifting strategy to a greater extent than males. Additionally, females exhibited higher vertical elbow positions during load rotation, moved their body toward the destination for load deposit, and did not reduce peak right shoulder flexion velocities, in contrast to male participants. Females also had greater low back and shoulder peak normalized joint moments. When fatigued, females adopted an asymmetric lifting strategy that minimized metabolic demand as supported by smaller decreases in maximum voluntary contractions. However, females' fatigue-related adaptations increased biomechanical exposures associated with injury risk.",

This work investigates the effects of speech to measure drivers’ trust in the AVs. Seventy-five participants were randomly assigned to high-trust (the AVs with 100% correctness, 0 crash, and 4 system messages with visual-auditory TORs) and low-trust group (the AVs with a correctness of 60%, a crash rate of 40%, 2 system messages with visual-only TORs). Voice interaction tasks were used to collect speech information during the driving process. The results revealed that our settings successfully induced trust and distrust states. The corresponding extracted speech feature data of the two trust groups were used for back-propagation neural network training and evaluated for its ability to accurately predict the trust classification. The highest classification accuracy of trust was 90.80%. This study proposes a method for accurately measuring trust in automated vehicles using voice recognition.",

    "abstract": "Internal logistics is crucial for hospitals, occurring within facilities that pose constraints and opportunities, demanding resilient performance (RP) to adapt to dynamic conditions and balance safety and efficiency pressures. However, the role of the built environment (BE) to support RP is not explicitly analysed in the hospital logistics literature, which is usually limited to discuss BE in terms of layout and routing issues. To address this gap, this study presents a knowledge framework of BE supportive of RP in internal hospital logistics. The framework was developed based on a study in a large teaching hospital, encompassing 11 service flows of people and supplies between an intensive care unit and other units. Data collection was based on 38 interviews, documents such as floor plans, and observations of logistics activities. Seven BE design principles developed in a previous study, concerned with RP in general but not focused on logistics, were adopted as initial themes for data analysis. Results of the thematic analysis gave rise to a knowledge framework composed of seven design prescriptions and 63 practical examples of BE supportive of RP in hospital internal logistics. The paper discusses how these prescriptions and examples are connected to resilience management. The framework is new in the context of internal hospital logistics and offers guidance to both BE and logistics designers.",

In this study we investigate the influence of visuospatial ability on laparoscopic simulator performance under such non-zero optical angles. Novices were invited to participate in a laparoscopic training session. After completing a visuospatial ability assessment, they performed a simplified laparoscopic task on an in-house developed laparoscopic simulator under eight different optical angles ranging between 0° and 315° in steps of 45°. Data-analysis showed decreased performance under all non-zero optical angles for task duration (mean difference between 1506 and 5049 ms, standard error between 499 and 507, p < .05) and for accuracy under optical angles greater than ±45° (mean difference between 1.48 and 2.11, standard error 0.32, p < .01). Performance-zones were identified for various optical angle ranges and differed for task duration and accuracy. Participants of high visuospatial ability performed significantly better under non-zero angles for accuracy compared to participants of low visuospatial ability (mean difference 0.95, standard error 0.34, p < .01), except for the 180° optical angle (no difference).",

    "abstract": "Thermal comfort plays a crucial role in the performance and well-being of mountaineers, especially in extreme environments. The aim of this study was to develop a reliable protocol to assess the thermal comfort of mountaineering boots, with a specific focus on temperature variations in different regions of the foot and their correlation with physiological factors. Two different models of mountaineering boots were tested at two different environmental temperature (-15°C and -30°C). The mean skin temperature, measured according to International Standards BS EN ISO 9886:2004, was used as an indicator of overall thermal comfort. Physiological factors such as heart rate (HR), body mass index (BMI) and body surface area (BSA) were also measured to understand their relationship to thermoregulation. Kruskal-Wallis and Pearson's ProductMoment correlation tests were performed to investigate whether there was a statistically significant relationship. The results showed significant differences in foot temperature among the Testers, indicating variations in the perception of thermal comfort. The correlation analysis showed a strong positive relationship between mean skin temperature and HR, highlighting the influence of physiological factors on thermal comfort. In addition, the analysis showed that the dorsum and hallux areas had the largest temperature variations, suggesting the occurrence of vasoconstriction and potential discomfort. This study represents a preliminary approach to establishing a reliable protocol for assessing the thermal performance of cold protective footwear.",

Nevertheless, security concerns, resilience, and their mutual influence – especially at night – will likely be the most critical barriers to public adoption since passengers have to share rides with strangers without a human driver on board. Prior research points out that having information about fellow travelers could alleviate the concerns of passengers and we designed two user interface variants to investigate the role of this information in an exploratory within-subjects user study ( N = 24 ). Participants experienced four automated day and night rides with varying personal information about co-passengers in a simulated environment. The results of the mixed-method study indicate that having information about other passengers (e.g., photo, gender, and name) positively affects user experience at night. In contrast, it is less necessary during the day. Considering participants' simultaneously raised privacy concerns, balancing security and privacy demands poses a substantial challenge for resilient system design.",

    "abstract": "The Ottawa Paramedic Physical Ability Test (OPPAT) was launched in Ontario as a physical employment standard for front-line paramedics. When considering pass rates based on sex, males had a higher likelihood of passing than females. To help understand how to improve pass rates among females we aimed to understand if factors such as participant demographics, college type, employment status and/or peak heart rate (a surrogate of fitness level) were related to OPPAT pass rates. Females who were employed, who were educated in a public paramedic college, and who had higher body mass were more likely to successfully complete the OPPAT. Those educated in a public paramedic college were more than twice as likely to pass relative to those educated in a private college program. This may underscore a need to further explore different modes of paramedic education to understand why public college program trained students are more likely to pass.",

    "abstract": "Drivers must actively supervise automation as it can only function in limited conditions. A failure to supervise the system has negative consequences in terms of missed requests to take over control and may cause crashes or jeopardize safety. The objective of this study is to determine the effect of a novel, 3M (Mistakes, Mentoring, and Mastery) training program on drivers’ behavior while using level 2 driving automation systems. To achieve this, 36 participants were assigned randomly to three different training programs (3M training, User manual, and Placebo) and drove through scenarios on a fixed-based driving simulator. The results showed that drivers in the 3M training group took back control more effectively when the driving automation system reached its limits compared to drivers who received User manual or Placebo training. Drivers in the 3M training Group also had higher situation awareness and improved trust in automation. The results indicate that an interactive approach to training with regards to vehicle automation can help drivers more safely interact with automation systems.",

    "doi": "10.1016/j.apergo.2023.104206",
    "abstract": "Trams are experiencing a resurgence with worldwide network expansion driven by the need for sustainable and efficient cities. Trams often operate in shared or mixed-traffic environments, which raise safety concerns, particularly in hazardous situations. This paper adopts an international, mixed-methods approach, conducted through two interconnected studies in Melbourne (Australia) and Birmingham (UK). The first study involved qualitative interviews, while the second was an experimental study involving a virtual reality (VR) simulator and haptic master controller (i.e., speed lever). In tram operations, master controllers play a critical role in ensuring a smooth ride, which directly influences passenger safety and comfort. The objective was to understand how a master control system, enhanced with additional haptic feedback, could improve tram driver braking performance and perceptions in safety-critical scenarios. Interview results indicate that the use of the emergency brake is considered the final or ultimate choice by drivers, and their driving experience is a moderating factor in limiting its application. Combined with the experimental results, this paper highlights how implementing haptic feedback within a master controller can reduce the performance disparity between novice and experienced tram drivers.",

    "abstract": "Ear-related technologies are spreading in our daily life and have become essential in several applications. The comfort, retention and battery life of in-ear devices can be substantially improved by considering the dynamic behavior of the earcanal. A better understanding of the earcanal dynamic motion would not only result in the improved fit and performance of earpieces but could also pave the way to harvest energy from these movements to power future ear-related technologies. The contours of the left and right ears of 18 healthy subjects during closed mouth and 4 activities (mouth opening, turning head left, raising eyebrows and smiling) were discretized. Eight parameters were analyzed to investigate the possible relation between each of these face-related activities and the radial and axial deformations of the earcanal. The largest significant deformations in reference to the closed-mouth geometry were observed during mouth-opening and smiling at the earcanal entrance and between the two bends.",

    "abstract": "This study aimed to determine gravitational and dynamic torques and muscle activity of the neck across a series of design parameters of head mounted displays (mass, center of mass, and counterweights) associated with virtual and augmented reality (VR/AR). Twenty young adult participants completed five movement types (Slow and Fast Flexion/Extension and Rotation, and Search) while wearing a custom-designed prototype headset that varied the three design parameters: display mass (0, 200, 500, and 750 g), distance of the display's center of mass in front of the eyes (approximately 1, 3, and 5 cm anteriorly), and counterweights of 0, 166, 332, and 500 g to balance the display mass of 500 g at 7 cm. Inverse dynamics of a link segment model of the head and headset provided estimates of the torques about the joint between the skull and the occiput-first cervical vertebrae (OC1) and joint between the C7 and T1 vertebrae (C7). Surface electromyography (EMG) measured bilateral muscle activity of the splenius and upper trapezius muscles. Adding 750 g of display mass nearly doubled root mean square joint torques across all movement types. Increasing the distance of the display mass in front of the eyes by 4 cm increased torques about OC1 for the Slow and Fast Rotation and Search movements by approximately 20%. Adding a counterweight decreased torques about OC1 during the rotation and search tasks but did not decrease the torques experienced in the lower cervical spine (C7). For the flexion/extension axis, the magnitude of the dynamic torque component was 20% or less of the total torque experienced whereas for the rotation axis the magnitude of the dynamic torque component was greater than 50% of the total torque. Surface EMG root mean square values significantly varied across movement types with the fast rotation having the largest values; however, they did not vary significantly across the headset configurations.",

The reliability of 3D measurements gathered from 3D scans must be assessed to understand the degree to which this technology is appropriate for use in place of manual anthropometric methods. The intra- and inter-rater reliabilities of 3D facial measurements were assessed among four novice raters using 3D landmarking. Intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) statistics were calculated for the 3D measurement data collected in three phases to assess baseline reliabilities and improvements in reliabilities as the result of additional training and experience. Based on the results of this study, the researchers found that the collection of 3D measurement data, by multiple raters and using 3D landmarking methods, yielded a high percentage of ICC statistics in the good to excellent (>0.75 ICC) reliability range. Rater training and experience were important considerations in improving intra- and inter-rater reliabilities.",

This pilot study aims at proposing a methodology able to quantify biomechanical requirements of meat cutting tasks at butchers’ dominant wrist and, when necessary, at estimating the assistance needed to reach sustainability. Six professional butchers repeatedly cut pieces of pork. Joint angles were recorded using a motion capture system, cutting forces using an instrumented knife. Sustainability was computed by the maximal acceptable effort method. Assistance requirements were computed for isolated stressful exertions and for overall work cycle sustainability. Five butchers exceeded the sustainability threshold for wrist flexion. Ulnar or radial deviation torques were excessive for 2 and 3 of them, respectively. Extension torques were sustainable. The peak assistive torque for isolated exertions was at most 1.1Nm, 1.6Nm and 1.1Nm, and the percentage of assistance for overall sustainability was at most 60%, 56% and 56% for wrist flexion, ulnar and radial deviation, respectively.",

We aim to explore the role of the built environment in safety issues related to being physically active in rehabilitation. We conducted a case study at a free-standing rehabilitation center for patients with Multiple Sclerosis, neurologic, or locomotor issues. Patients participated in two interviews supported by activity tracking data. Care professionals participated in focus group interviews respectively with two therapists and four head nurses. Accessibility and physical barriers, visual connections and (in)dependence, and spatial familiarity are important themes when identifying aspects of the built environment in relation to reducing safety issues patients encounter during physical activity. Raising awareness about each of these among care and design professionals could help them to balance safety issues in relation to physical activity and to communicate about them in a nuanced way.",

    "abstract": "This study employs sequence-network analysis to investigate the influence of instructing a standardized procedure on total-body skin examination (TBSE) performance. A between-subjects study was conducted with thirty-one participants comprising medical students and attending physicians. Among these participants, fifteen were randomly assigned to the uninstructed group and sixteen to the instructed group. The participants' gaze and field of view were recorded using eye tracking glasses while performing TBSE on a male and a female standardized patient. The recordings were then transcribed to depict the examination process. The instructed group missed significantly fewer body parts (p = 0.045) and had higher time efficiency (p = 0.007) while examining the female patient, but no significant difference was observed for the male patient examination. Furthermore, the examination sequences of the instructed group contained lesser variability than the uninstructed group. Hence, implementing a standard optimal procedure to perform TBSE could minimize the likelihood of missing body parts, increase examination efficiency, and improve performance consistency. This study demonstrated the potential of sequence-network analysis to study human performance in sequential tasks.",

    "abstract": "A lack of navigator's Situation Awareness (SA) is one of the leading causes of maritime accidents. Visually observing the area surrounding a vessel continues to be a critical aspect and best practice of safe navigation to establish and maintain SA. Augmented Reality (AR) allows the placement of information in a user's field of view, which can encourage navigators to spend more time looking up at their external environment whilst still having access to operational data. However, empirical evidence on the impact of AR on maritime operations is limited. This paper investigates the effects of AR on navigator SA & Head-Down Time (HDT) using a within-group quasi-experimental design. Seventeen licensed navigators and nautical students analysed twelve navigation scenarios: six non-AR (control) and six AR (experimental) scenarios using a maritime training simulator. SA was measured via SAGAT scores for each scenario and the SA-SWORD to compare preferences. Each scenario was video recorded and analysed for participant's total amount of HDT and head-down occurrences in each scenario. Results found that the addition of AR significantly reduced participant HDT (by a factor of 2.67) and head-down occurrences (by 62%) in comparison to navigation scenarios without AR. Furthermore, AR did not significantly improve mean SA. This study contributes to the limited empirical data on the effects of AR on operator performance, demonstrating the potential value of AR for improving SA and facilitating increased head-up time during maritime navigation, which in turn could improve safety at sea.",

    "abstract": "Muscle fatigue monitoring, an important element in a fatigue risk management process, can help optimize work intensity and reduce risks for musculoskeletal injuries. An experiment was conducted to determine whether myoelectric manifestations of muscle fatigue can reflect the pace of fatigue development associated with varying load intensity. Twenty male participants performed elbow flexion-extension movements with alternating hand loads (2 kg vs. 1 kg) for 16 min. The pace of fatigue in the biceps brachii in response to load variation was quantified by electromyographic (EMG) fatigue measures collected during the dynamic elbow flexion-extension movements and periodic submaximal isometric elbow flexion trials. The isometric and dynamic EMG measures, except for the amplitude of dynamic EMG, indicated fatigue development during the 2-kg isotonic movements and partial recovery with the 1 kg load. Study results suggest the potential of EMG measures for fatigue monitoring during dynamic work tasks with varying load intensity.",

    "abstract": "This paper describes the co-design and development process of an evidence-informed e-training program (Sit-Stand e-Guide) to support the safe and optimal use of sit-stand workstations from ergonomics and behavioural change perspectives. Using an instructional system design process, supported by a participatory design approach, data was collected through three workshops with workplace consumers (staff [n = 5] and managers [n = 5]), and subject matter experts (n = 5). Content and learning activities were developed based on behaviour change principles and optimal pedagogy. Key topics identified for the e-training were sedentary behaviour and health; workstation set-up; and strategies for behaviour change. Learning activities (scenarios and reflection) to enhance knowledge retention and skills implementation and an interactive one-page guide on completion were included in the e-training. The relevance and usefulness of the training prototype were reviewed through one-to-one think-aloud sessions with the workshop consumers (n = 5) and external health and safety professionals (n = 5) receiving positive feedback. The Sit-Stand e-Guide is readily available for workplace implementation and evaluation. This paper serves as a practical guide for future training development.",

This study investigated the effects of display, Touchscreen and Augmented Reality (AR), on a standardized 2D multidirectional target acquisition task. Thirty-two participants performed the target acquisition task with both modality types and at two indexes of difficulty. The touchscreen modality yielded improved performance over AR as measured by accuracy, precision, error rates, throughput, and movement time. Throughput using the nominal index of difficulty was 10.12 bits/s for touchscreen and 3.11 bits/s for AR. AR designers can use the results to improve performance when designing AR interfaces by selecting larger buttons when accuracy and efficiency are required and by embedding perception cues to button target surfaces such as depth and proximity cues.",

    "abstract": "This study examined the feasibility of workload monitoring to assess internal workload in law enforcement officers (LEO) using a multi-methodological approach. Fifty front-line LEO completed workload surveys on workdays for eight weeks. Retention and adherence were assessed across the survey period. LEO completed usability and likelihood to continue questionnaires, while departmental administrators (n = 8) received workload reports and completed utility and sustainability questionnaires. A subsample of LEO and administrators participated in semi-structured interviews, following consensual qualitative research design. LEO retention (96%), survey adherence (94%), and usability scores (88.3/100) were high, with a moderate likelihood to continue to use the survey. Administration reported high utility and sustainability. The high adherence rates and usability scores, coupled with strong administrative support, suggest that workload monitoring may be a feasible strategy among LEO to monitor occupational workloads. The LEO and administration feedback highlight areas of improvement (e.g., data transparency, departmental collaboration) to inform future implementation.",

    "abstract": "This study investigated how different shapes of umbrella handles and grip types influence muscle activation and postural variability under windy conditions. Seventeen adult participants were enrolled in this study, and different handle shapes (cylindrical, ellipsoidal, and triangular prism-shaped), grip types (four- and five-finger grip), and wind strengths were tested. Activation of the forearm and upper arm muscles was recorded using surface electromyography. Postural variability and ratings of (1) perceived difficulty of use and (2) perceived grip-posture variability were measured. The results indicated that activation of the finger flexor muscle increased under windy conditions, whereas postural variability was not affected. Weak wind (3.2–7.5 m/s) conditions caused greater perceived postural variability and activation of the wrist extensor muscle. The ellipsoidal handle shape had lower endpoint postural variability when held with a five-finger grip and also had lower perceived postural variability and difficulty compared to that with the cylindrical shape. Our findings can be used to select appropriate umbrella handle designs based on grip type and wind conditions.",

    "abstract": "Fatigue in offshore environments is a critical safety hazard, yet the utility of daily fatigue assessments has not been longitudinally examined in these environments. The aim of this exploratory longitudinal field study across two drillships in the Gulf of Mexico was to determine the changes in subjective, performance-based, and physiological fatigue measures over time across different shift types (day, night, and swing) and to identify correlations between these multimodal fatigue assessments. Repeated measures correlation analyses of daily fatigue data from seventy offshore workers revealed that while total sleep time remained unaffected by time on rig, workers’ performances on the psychomotor vigilance test (PVT) deteriorated over time across all shift types. Several correlations between the various multimodal measures were consistent with the extant literature on worker fatigue symptoms and perceptual and physiological manifestations. These findings emphasize the utility of PVT and single item self-reports to capture worker fatigue in offshore shiftwork.",

    "abstract": "The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of arm- and back-support exoskeletons on reactive balance after slip-like and trip-like perturbations on a treadmill. Twenty-eight participants used two arm-support exoskeletons and two back-support exoskeletons with support (i.e., assistive joint torque) activated or deactivated. In each exoskeleton condition, as well in as a control without any exoskeleton, participants were exposed to 12 treadmill perturbations during upright standing. The exoskeletons did not significantly increase the probability of a failed recovery after the perturbations compared to wearing no exoskeleton, but did elicit effects on kinematic variables that suggested balance recovery was more challenging. Moreover, reactive balance differed when wearing back-support and arm-support exoskeletons, and when wearing an activated exoskeleton compared to a deactivated exoskeleton. Together, our results suggest these exoskeletons may increase the risk of slip- and trip-induced falls. The potential mechanisms of this increased risk are discussed and include the added mass and/or motion restrictions associated with wearing these exoskeletons. Our results do not support the assistive hip/back extension moment provided by back-support exoskeletons adversely affecting fall risk.",

Three force patterns, chosen to mimic exoskeleton use, were applied to the thigh of 15 healthy participants for 30 min. Changes in perceived comfort and skin effects were recorded. Discomfort was detected at normal forces ranging from 40 to >230 N. Repetitive force application triggered discomfort after a median of 4.1 min (normal force only) and 5.4 min (normal and shear force) respectively. Discomfort increased over time but the repetitive force applications did generally not result in pain and there were no significant differences between repetitive loading patterns. Exoskeleton design and use should be informed by comfort thresholds specific to prolonged repetitive loading. Large interindividual differences in perception of discomfort limit the possibilities for generally applicable comfort thresholds. Further research is needed to investigate how patient groups perceive such repetitive loading.",

Such methods display a step-wise change between risk levels, yielding inadequate assessment accuracy and posing challenges to human health assurance in HSM. To address these issues, this study proposes a spatial relationship-aware rapid entire body fuzzy assessment technique. The proposed method enhances the rapid entire body assessment (REBA) by enacting a dynamic evaluation of WMSD-related risk via a deep learning-based 3D pose reconstruction. Contrary to the step-wise transitions between REBA's different risk levels, the proposed method actualizes a fuzzy assessment of WMSD risk by introducing weights between these levels. This innovation allows for a more accurate risk assessment for workers engaged in HSM. Validation through experiments conducted on data from an automobile production line demonstrates that the proposed method can achieve a precision rate of 99.31%.

    "abstract": "The delivery of home care in England is explored with respect to (a) the work system (b) the barriers that challenge worker performance, and most importantly (c) whether these barriers impact the quality and safety of the care received by older adults. Data were collected using surveys and interviews with home care workers (n = 11). The analysis used two validated Human Factors and Ergonomics (HFE) models to map the data which identified three key performance barriers; (1) time factors, (2) organisational practices, and (3) job design. Adaptive behaviour was identified as being routine to manage time barriers, which resulted in trade-offs between care outcomes (delivery), quality and safety standards and work-related quality of life. The findings make an important contribution to the limited research literature on home care work by highlighting the opportunity for an HFE systems perspective to provide a novel approach for both understanding home care and building better home care systems.",

    "doi": "10.1016/j.apergo.2023.104161",
    "abstract": "While much research has focused on the deleterious effects of stress on goal-directed behavior in recent decades, current views increasingly discuss growth under stress, often assuming dose-dependent effects of stress in a curvilinear association. This is based on the concept of hormesis, which postulates a strengthening effect of stress at low-to-moderate doses. Leveraging this approach, hormetic curves indicate under which stress dose an individual is able to maintain or even increase goal-directed behavior. The present study aimed to test the hormetic effect of low-to-moderate stress on tactical movement performance in the context of police operational scenarios in virtual reality. In teams of three to four, 37 riot police officers had to search a building for a potentially aggressive perpetrator in three scenarios with escalating stress potential (i.e., increasing weapon violence and number of civilians). Tactical movement performance as behavioral response was quantified by the sample entropy of each officer's velocity derived from positional data. To account for inter-individuality in response to the scenarios, we assessed self-reported stress, anxiety, mental effort, and vagally mediated heart rate variability. Specifically, we tested the quadratic associations between tactical movement performance and stress parameters, respectively. Random-intercept-random-slope regressions revealed neither significant linear nor quadratic associations between any of the stress parameters and performance. While we did not find evidence for hormesis in the present study, it stimulates theoretical discussions about the definition of “baseline” functioning and how the understanding of hormesis can move from psychological to behavioral adaptations to stressors.",

    "abstract": "The identification of personalized preventive strategies plays a major role in contrasting the occurrence of work-related musculoskeletal disorders. This requires the identification of distinct movement patterns within large samples and the attribution of a proper risk level to each identified movement phenotype. We assessed the feasibility of this approach by exploiting wearable inertial measurement units to estimate the whole-body kinematics of 43 healthy participants performing 18 reach-to-manipulate movements, which differed based on the object's position in the space and the type of manipulation required. Through unsupervised clustering, we identified multiple movement phenotypes graded by ergonomic performance. Furthermore, we determined which joints mostly contributed to instantiating the ergonomic differences across clusters, emphasizing the importance of monitoring this aspect during occupational gestures. Overall, our analysis suggests that movement phenotypes can be identified within occupational motor repertoires. Assigning individual performance to specific phenotypes has the potential to inform the development of more effective and tailored interventions.",

    "doi": "10.1016/j.apergo.2023.104162",
    "abstract": "Research has shown that timing is modulated by mental workload, making duration judgments a measure of cognitive demand, alongside subjective assessments, and physiological measurements. Yet, it is unclear whether such findings can be extended in less controlled setups. By employing air traffic controllers in a real aviation environment, we tested whether tasks with different levels of cognitive load can affect their timing behavior. Participants completed temporal production, verbal estimation, and passage of time judgments, while actively engaging in real flight control sessions. Subjective assessments of task demands, as well as physiological responses (cardiac and electrodermal activity) were also measured. Accuracy of the produced intervals was measured at two distinct phases of the flight (during low-load cruising vs. high-load landing) and under two different task load manipulations (controlling one vs. two helicopters and speaking in native vs. non-native language). Analysis of interval production accuracy showed that during the high-load landing phase significant overproductions were made, compared to the low-load cruising phase, and landing two helicopters led to greater overproductions compared to landing only one. The duration of the two-helicopter sessions was significantly overestimated compared to the single-helicopter ones, and the passage of time was felt significantly faster. Subjective assessments of workload were positively correlated with the temporal estimations and passage of time judgments, and skin responses were positively correlated with the produced intervals. Overall, our results are consistent with past research, suggesting that mental workload modulates time perception in complex, real-world environments, thus making timing behavior a reliable index of the workload changes.",

Using immersive Virtual Reality related digital technology to assist and enhance nurse education is promising but not yet fully understood. This study aims to understand the effectiveness and efficacy of immersive Virtual Reality nursing education approaches through a comparative pilot study. Three immersive Virtual Reality scenarios based on basic nursing skills were developed. A traditional video lecture approach including the same contents was used as a comparable approach to investigate the effectiveness and efficacy performance of the proposed immersive Virtual Reality approach. 22 participants were recruited from a college. Effectiveness was measured through motivation and knowledge gain, while efficacy was evaluated through simulation sickness, user experience, and system usability. The results showed that the VR approach has above “acceptable” efficacy performance, which indicates participants are willing to accept this novel education approach. The effectiveness results indicate that the VR approach has similar performance with the video approach in delivering nursing contents. One limitation of this investigation is that the sample size is relatively small and further larger sample sizes are needed for future analysis.",

    "abstract": "Resilient performance is a crucial characteristic of complex socio-technical systems, enabling them to sustain essential functionality during changing or stressful conditions. Resilience Engineering (RE), a sub-field of safety research, focuses on this perspective of resilience. RE emphasises its “cornerstone model”, presenting the RE system goals of “anticipating, monitoring, responding and learning”. The cornerstone of learning remains fragmented and undertheorized in the existing literature. This paper aims to enrich RE research and its practical implications by developing a nuanced and comprehensive understanding of the role of learning from resilient performance. To achieve this aim, a scoping literature review was conducted to assess how learning is conceptualised in the RE literature and the theoretical foundations on which previous work rest. The main findings show that RE researchers view learning as the process of understanding the system, sharing knowledge, and re-designing system properties. The application of established learning theories is limited. This paper contributes to research by proposing an organisational process for the RE cornerstone of learning, paving the way for deeper discussions in future studies about learning from resilient performance within complex socio-technical systems.",

    "doi": "10.1016/j.apergo.2023.104181",
    "abstract": "While participatory ergonomics (PE) presents numerous benefits, its empirical effectiveness remains elusive due to the lack of transparency in implementation contexts and processes. This hinders our ability to discern the reasons behind a program's success or failure and to determine optimization and adaptation strategies. To unravel this “black box,” we present a case study using implementation science to evaluate a PE program and illuminate the mechanisms linking process to outcome. The study examines a 4.5-year PE program at a construction company, targeting musculoskeletal disorders (MSDs) from material-cart handling. Using the RE-AIM framework and Implementation Causal Pathway Model, we evaluated implementation process and catalogued contextual factors through worker surveys (n = 106), safety document review (27 training sessions and 7 construction projects), and key informant observations. We assessed the program's impact using a 42-worker survey and an analysis of 8-year injury data, and determined the return-on-investment (ROI) by monetizing the collected data. The program achieved significant impact: Workers' ergonomic knowledge improved from 73% in baseline to 86% in follow-up; 97% of workers reported at least one positive change in their crews; and no cart handling injuries occurred after the first program change, resulting in a ROI rate of 1.99. Implementation process evaluation revealed that seamless integration, tailored intervention, and ongoing adjustments contributed to the success. Five organizational factors necessary for the effective functioning of these three strategies were identified, along with three moderators that amplified their influence. Finally, this case study demonstrates that implementation science offers a coherent structure for evaluating PE programs, uncovering mechanisms of change, and informing future improvements and adaptations. Our research facilitates knowledge transfer from implementation science to ergonomics, eventually leading to more cost-effective PE programs that are faithfully implemented across various industrial settings to prevent MSDs.",

The aim of this narrative review is to evaluate the literature on typical physical workloads, such as lifting/carrying and forced position (during surgery) and predictors of injuries. The health complaints of veterinarians were also examined. Methods Diverse databases were used. Prevalence rates of total workloads (also including surgery), health complaints, musculoskeletal discomfort, and predictors of injury, musculoskeletal disorders, and precaution awareness were examined. Results Thirteen studies were included. The most prevalent injury was animal attacks (9%–84%). Working in large and mixed practice types were predictors of injuries or musculoskeletal disorders (e.g., shoulder, lower back, head/neck) compared to other types of practice. Conclusion The study findings presented here clearly show a high need for intervention to minimize and prevent occupational risks. Ergonomic working conditions and occupational safety training can reduce the risk of musculoskeletal disorders.",

    "abstract": "Social stress at work can lead to severe consequences. As a result of technological developments, social stress will increasingly be induced by machines. It is therefore crucial to understand how machine-induced social stress affects operators. The present study aimed to compare human and machine-induced social stress with regard to its effect on primary and secondary task performance, and on subjective state (e.g., self-esteem, mood and justice). 90 participants worked on a high-fidelity simulation of a complex work environment, on which they had received extensive training (2h15). Social stress was induced by a human or a machine using a combination of negative performance feedback and ostracism. Results indicate that social stress did not affect performance, affect or state self-esteem. Machine-induced and human-induced social stress overall had similar effects, except for the latter impairing perceived justice. We discuss implications of these results for automation at the workplace and outline future research directions.",

    "abstract": "Shoe outsole design strongly influences slip and fall risk. Certain tread features that can be readily measured have been shown to predict friction performance. This research aimed to replicate those findings and quantify their ability to predict slipping. Participants (n = 34) were exposed to a low friction oil-coated floor surface, while wearing slip-resistant shoes. The coefficient of friction (COF) of each shoe were predicted based on tread surface area, the presence of a bevel, and hardness. The COF was measured, and the slip outcome was determined. Predicted and measured COF were correlated, and measured COF was a sensitive predictor of slip outcome. The relationship of predicted COF on slip outcome was weaker than anticipated and was not statistically significant. This study partially confirmed the ability of previous regression equations to predict COF. However, the effect size was weaker than previously reported and predicted COF was not sensitive for predicting slips.",

    "abstract": "Purpose Falls are a risk factor for mortality in older adults. Lighting interventions can improve cognitive and motor task performance, but the effect on postural control with relevance to falling is unknown. Methods Sixteen older adults participated in an intervention study with blue-enriched light delivered visually and/or transcranially for 12 min. Postural control in three conditions (60s eyes-open, dual-task, and eyes-closed), lower-limb motor coordination, and cognitive function were assessed. Results Relative to placebo, visual blue-enriched light improved reaction time in the motor coordination task by 0.073 ± 0.035s (d = 0.77 ± 0.39; p = 0.003). Visual exposure decreased Area of Sway relative to the combined (d = 0.38 ± 0.26; p = 0.020) and placebo interventions (d = 0.47 ± 0.42; p = 0.067), with no significant effect on cognition. Conclusion Blue-enriched lighting demonstrates a novel approach to positively impact postural control and motor coordination in older adults. By impacting metrics associated with fall risk, light interventions may provide a clinical countermeasure to decrease the human costs of falls.",

However, most models are limited to expert performance with rough adjustments to consider novices despite prior studies suggesting novices' cognitive, perceptual, and motor behaviors are different from experts. The objective of this study was to develop a cognitive performance model for novice law enforcement officers (N-CPM) to model their performance and memory load while interacting with in-vehicle technology. The model was validated based on a ride-along study with 10 novice law enforcement officers (nLEOs). The findings suggested that there were no significant differences between the N-CPM and observation data in most cases, while the results of the benchmark model were different from that of N-CPM. The model can be applied to improve future nLEO's patrol mission performance through redesigning in-vehicle technologies and training methods to reduce their workload and driving distraction.",

Materials and methods We conducted a crossover study of 26 workers measured during two work days with and without the use of a passive shoulder exoskeleton and a lifting glove at a Danish slaughterhouse. Electromyography sensors were placed bilateral on 5 shoulder muscles. The 10th, 50th, and 90th percentiles of muscle activity normalized by maximal voluntary contractions were measured and analyzed using mixed effect models. Results For the 50th percentiles of the agonist muscles, the exoskeleton reduced muscle activity bilaterally for deltoid anterior with up to 29.47%, deltoid middle with 10.22%, and upper trapezius with 22.21%. The lifting glove only reduced muscle activity for right deltoid anterior (36.59%) and upper trapezius (7.11%), but generally increased left muscle activity with up to 15.58%. Discussion The exoskeleton showed larger reductions in muscle activity compared to the lifting glove.",

The study demonstrated static postural stability deteriorates at higher virtual altitudes and during DT and improves with training. The findings of the study suggest that virtual reality is a great altitude simulator, which could be used as a potential balance training tool in ergonomic settings.",

    "abstract": "Foot positioning strategies are a key parameter in manual materials handling. The objective of this study was to assess the effects of transfer distance, pace and foot positioning on low back loading. Sixteen handlers performed a free handling task with conditions of pace (self-selected and 25% faster), distance (1.5 m, 1.0 m and 0.5 m), height (near-ground and above-waist levels), and mass (10 kg and 20 kg). A linear mixed model was used to evaluate the effects of mass, distance, pace and height on foot positioning occurrences. A non-parametric test (nparLD) was used to evaluate the effects of Pace × Foot positioning and Distance × Foot positioning on L5/S1 sagittal and asymmetrical moments. Positioning the feet aside from the lifting pallet was more prevalent when transferring at shorter transfer distances, high lifting height, and faster pace. When the feet were oriented aside the lifting area, asymmetrical peak moments were slightly higher when transferring at short distance. Facing the lifting pallet may ensure load symmetry, but orienting the feet aside may help to adapt to fast pace or short transfer distance.",

Pupillometry offers a good possibility to measure mental workload in a dynamic work setting. Currently, there is a lack of empirical research in the context of healthcare settings. Therefore, the aim of the present study was to examine whether specific eye movement measures are suitable for measuring mental workload in the healthcare setting, especially when working with HIS. 49 persons participated in our simulation-lab study. They had to complete a system-related task as well as an increasing n-back task. Both tasks were modified regarding task difficulty. Results show significant differences for objective and subjective workload measures between increasing task levels. There are also hints for an overload/fatigue indicator in pupil data. Our results are limited in terms of external validity, causality and effects. Future work should focus on high-fidelity simulations and less time-consuming analysis approaches.",

    "abstract": "Aim We analyzed the biomechanical response (joint angles, moments, and powers) to running with added leg mass. These data may help guide the design of wearable locomotor assistive devices (i.e., exoskeletons), which are becoming more prevalent. Methods 15 participants (7 females, 8 males) completed treadmill running trials ( 3 m • s − 1 ) normally and with lead mass (300–1350 g) attached to the thigh, shank, or foot, bilaterally. We quantified the lower limb biomechanics combining motion capture and ground reaction force data using standard inverse dynamics analysis. Results Only moderate kinematic changes occurred in response to the distal added limb mass. Maximum hip flexion and maximum knee flexion angles during swing phase increased by approximately 9% and 6% respectively for each 1 kg added to each foot. However, adding even small masses made dramatic changes to the joint moments and powers, mostly during the swing phase. For example, adding 1 kg to each foot increased maximum joint moments by as much as 40% (knee extension in late swing) and maximum joint power by as much as 50% (hip generation in late swing). Conclusion Leg joint kinematics were largely conserved in response to adding mass to the legs. Adding mass to the leg distally increased joint power mainly at the knee and hip joints during the swing phase, whereas adding mass proximally mainly affected the ankle joint mechanics during the stance phase. These changes have implications for shoe designs, people who run with added mass on their legs for sport/strength training and for the design of wearable devices.",

    "abstract": "Driver drowsiness is a factor in at least 20% of serious motor vehicle accidents. Although research has shown that Whole-Body Vibration (WBV) can induce drowsiness in drivers, it is unknown whether particular frequencies are more problematic. The present study systematically investigated the influence of WBV frequency on driver drowsiness. Fifteen participants each undertook six 1-h sessions of simulated driving while being subjected to WBV of either 0 Hz (no vibration), 1–4 Hz, 4–8 Hz, 8–16 Hz, 16–32 Hz or 32–64 Hz. Subjective sleepiness, as measured by the Karolinska Sleepiness Scale (KSS), confirmed that drivers felt drowsier when exposed to the two lowest frequency ranges (1–4 Hz and 4–8 Hz). Reaction time, which measures attention and alertness, was significantly impaired by the two lowest frequency ranges. Objective driving performance measures (Standard Deviation of Lane Position (SDLP), Standard Deviation of (SD) Steering Angle, Time in Unsafe Zone) also showed significant degradation due to exposure to the two lowest frequency ranges. Exposure to 1–4 Hz or 4–8 Hz vibration caused attention to become significantly impaired within 15–20 min and driving performance to be significantly impaired by 30–35 min. The other frequency ranges had little or no effect. These findings point to a need to develop equivalent vibration-induced drowsiness contours that can be adopted as transportation safety standards.",

    "abstract": "The Incident Commander (IC) decision-making process has previously been modeled primarily by qualitative evaluation methods, which has made it difficult to generalize an objective model. In this study, we took a quantitative approach to elucidate a decision-making model based on the “dual-process” model that consists of instantaneous decisions (“System 1”) and considered decisions (“System 2”) to gain new insights regarding the IC decision-making process. High-fidelity simulation data from eight mass-casualty incidents (MCIs) were analyzed in two categories. The first category represents cues of new information and the IC's actions, divided into three main subcategories: actions following the MCI protocol, responses following cues, and actions without a cue. The second category divides the simulation into three MCI management phases: (1) evaluation and triage, (2) treatment and preparedness for evacuation, and (3) evacuation. Actions that followed the MCI protocol were significantly higher in the first phase compared to the other two phases ( p < 0.01 for both phases). Responses following cues were significantly higher in the second phase compared to the first ( p < 0.01 ). Actions without a cue were significantly higher in both the second and third phases compared to the first ( p < 0.01 for both phases). The results reveal that the IC followed MCI protocol guidance in the simulation initiation and immediately responded to cues, which fits “System 1”. As the simulation evolved, the IC made more planned tasks and initiated actions without leading cues, which fits “System 2”. The study found that ICs can change their decision-making mode, and this understanding can serve to improve their decision-making process and increase casualty survival rates.",

    "abstract": "Musculoskeletal disorders (MSDs) significantly impact workers in the manufacturing and construction sectors. One solution that has gained interest to reduce MSDs incidence is the use of exoskeletons. In this study, the influence of an upper limb exoskeleton on muscle activity was investigated experimentally for three commonly performed tasks in the manufacturing and construction sectors. The tasks tested were overhead assembly, bricklaying, and box moving tasks. Eighteen males participated in the tests. The results showed a reduction in shoulder flexor muscle activation during all three tasks (up to -45.46 ± 4.52% for the anterior deltoid), but increased extensor activation (up to 15.47 ± 8.01% for the latissimus dorsi) was observed when the task was not primarily performed above shoulder level. The results revealed the dependence of the upper-body exoskeleton on tasks and arm posture, which should be considered for both in-field applications and designing new exoskeletons for performance enhancement.",

    "abstract": "As autonomous driving technology advances, the possibility of using vehicles as sleeping environments becomes increasingly relevant. To investigate the feasibility of this concept, a sleep study was conducted with twelve participants who were given a 4-h opportunity window to sleep in both reclined and flat seat configurations. The evaluation involved both objective measures, including polysomnographic (PSG) data analysis, and subjective measures through questionnaires, assessing sleep quality and comfort. While the sleep quantity results were comparable between the two sleeping positions, the reclined position showed a slight advantage in sleep quantity (TST and WASO). Interestingly, a trend highlighting a possible difference was found between the seat positions regarding non-rapid eye movement stage 3 (NREM 3). NREM 3 tended to be in a higher proportion of total sleep time in the flat seat position. Sleep onset latency (SOL) also showed a trend of a shorter latency by participants in the flat position. Additionally, most participants reported a preference for the flat position over the reclined position. These findings suggest that a flat seat configuration could offer a more comfortable and restful sleep environment for passengers in autonomous vehicles.",

    "abstract": "Background Wearable exoskeletal devices can enhance locomotor performance, but their mass results in a metabolic penalty. Previous studies have quantified the metabolic cost of running with added mass on the feet, but less is known about the effects of adding mass to the thigh and shank segments. Aim To quantify the metabolic cost of running with additional leg mass. Methods 15 participants (7 F, 8 M) completed treadmill running trials (3 m/s) normally and with lead mass (300–1350 g) attached to either the thigh, shank, or foot, bilaterally. We measured metabolic power using expired gas analysis. Results Per 1000 g of added mass per leg, gross metabolic power increased by approximately 16% (foot) and 11% (shank) for females which was slightly greater than the 11% and 8% increases for males, respectively. For thigh loading, metabolic power increased by just 4% per 1000 g in both sexes. Conclusion Adding mass more distally on the leg increases the metabolic cost of running to a greater extent. For the same absolute added mass on the foot or shank, metabolic power increases more in females.",

    "abstract": "Domestic information processing appliances include embedded digital technologies with which users interact. The designs of such appliances tend to be technology oriented and not well-suited to the needs of older adults. This is problematic because these appliances are essential in many activities of daily living and so affect the ability of people to live independently. This paper introduces a coding scheme for the analysis of users' interactions with such appliances and uses it to inform recommendations for the design of operational interfaces and associated instructional materials. The efficacy of the coding scheme as a design evaluation tool is illustrated by its application in a microwave oven case study. The coding scheme considers four aspects of users' interactions with this type of device: information processing activities, including the gathering and interpretation of information from the appliance, its user manual and cooking instructions from food packaging; interactions with the device's user interface; concurrent verbalisation supporting problem-solving; and impediments to the user's workflow.",

    "abstract": "Background Biomechanical and pain prevalence differences between sex/gender groups are frequently attributed to biological differences between sexes without considering the influence of socially-constructed gender. This may lead to interventions which are insufficient and culturally unresponsive. This review reinterprets the evidence regarding differences in desk-based postural behaviour between sex/gender groups from a gender-based perspective. Methods Four prominent databases were searched using terms such as ‘desk based’, ‘posture’, and ‘position’. Articles were included if they objectively investigated desk-based positional variability, postural variability and/or habitual alignment in healthy adults. Results Nine studies were included. Differences were found in postural variability and habitual alignment between sex/gender groups and were not explored from a gender-based perspective. Conclusion Gender-based expectations regarding ‘acceptable’ posture and movement likely contribute to biomechanical and pain differences between genders. This should be considered by clinicians intending to affect patients' movement and postural patterns and by researchers working in this space.",

    "abstract": "The purpose of this study was to investigate manual performance of humans when using push buttons following cold water hand immersion. An experiment involving 29 human participants was carried out to measure the activation rate of twelve different shaped push buttons mounted on a novel test apparatus after their dominant hand was immersed in cold (2 °C) and thermoneutral (34 °C) water for 2 min. A series of standardized hand dexterity tests were completed to assess the participants' baseline tactile sensitivity in a dry thermoneutral state. The mean baseline performance of participants indicates that they were representative of the general population. The button test apparatus was developed specifically for this experiment and was comprised of 12 different buttons at different locations on the panel which were varying in size, surface shape and texture. After the participants immersed their dominant hand in the assigned temperature condition, their index finger was guided to the centre of the panel, and they were instructed to find and press as many buttons as they could in a 2-min time period using only their index finger. For the button panel test, the participants’ view was obstructed from seeing the buttons. The results of the study indicate that temperature does not influence the activation rate of the push buttons on the button test apparatus. In addition, button size (large) was the most significant factor, followed by shape (protruding), however button texture was not a significant parameter. Given that exposure to cold water reduces manual performance, along with anecdotal evidence from survival training centres that users sometimes struggle to activate PLBs, the motivation for this research was to understand how humans interact with these devices in cold water emergency situations. It is expected that the results of this research will be useful for designers of emergency signalling devices used for rescue at sea.",

We hypothesized that armour configurations with lower levels of torso soft armour coverage attenuate physiological and perceptual responses during exercise in the heat. Fifteen adults (5 females/10 males, 26 ± 5 years) walked (5 km/h, 1% incline, 1h) in dry heat (38 °C, 20% humidity) while wearing body armour that provided; i) high coverage (HC: 0.57 ± 0.09 m2, 18.5 ± 0.3 kg), ii) moderate coverage (MC: 0.44 ± 0.07 m2, 18.1 ± 0.3 kg), iii) low coverage (LC1: 0.21 ± 0.03 m2, 17.4 ± 0.1 kg), or iv) low coverage with weight equalization (LC2: 0.21 ± 0.03 m2, 18.6 ± 0.2 kg). Core temperature (Tcore), heart rate (HR), metabolic heat production (M-W), whole-body sweat rate (WBSR), and perceptual responses were measured. M-W during exercise (629 ± 126 W) did not differ between configurations (p = 0.30). The change in Tcore (HC: 0.88 ± 0.37 °C, MC: 0.85 ± 0.32 °C, LC1: 0.91 ± 0.38 °C, LC2: 0.89 ± 0.42 °C, p = 0.93), HR (HC: 97 ± 14 bpm, MC: 103 ± 16 bpm, LC1: 96 ± 15 bpm, LC2: 97 ± 20 bpm, p = 0.08), and WBSR (HC: 10.2 ± 3.4 g/min, MC: 10.3 ± 4.3 g/min, LC1: 9.9 ± 4.7 g/min, LC2: 10.4 ± 4.5 g/min, p = 0.84) did not differ between configurations.

Reducing torso soft armour coverage, with minimal reductions in armour load, does not reduce physiological or perceptual strain during walking in dry heat.",

Using survey data, including dimensions from the Copenhagen Psychosocial Questionnaire, from forty-one workers, we assessed work environment conditions and health at baseline, follow-up and in change scores between baseline and follow-up. At baseline, men and women reported similar scores, while foreign-born (FB) workers reported better work environment conditions than Swedish-born (SB) workers. During the pandemic, conditions generally declined for all workers, but FB reported smaller declines than SB. A consistent inequality hierarchy across the 4 groups was not clear at baseline, follow-up or in change scores between time points. The study suggests potential cultural differences may exist in how work environment conditions are experienced. This should be considered in future studies and when managing future crises.",

The intervention consisted of 4 sessions during a three-month period. Working technique, working postures, rated perceived exertion, pain intensity, and duration of computer use were measured at baseline and follow ups after 6 and 12 months. The intervention did not significantly improve working technique and working postures, nor reduce pain intensity and perceived exertion in the intervention group compared to the control group. However, there was a statistically significant reduction in reported pain intensity in the neck/shoulder for the whole group. Also, there was a trend that time spent with computer work without breaks was more reduced in the intervention group than in the control group.",

    "abstract": "Travel constraints can hinder the recruitment of eligible research participants in clinical trials, causing research timeline extensions, added costs, underpowered results, and early termination. Remote consenting can help solve these issues by allowing researchers and potential participants to connect remotely. This controlled experimental study investigates the effect of remote consenting on workload, workflow, usability, and barriers and facilitators to its implementation. Using a mixed experimental design, simulated consenting sessions were conducted with three different modalities (remote paper consent, eConsent, and teleconsent) with 23 researchers and 93 research participants. Each session involved a single researcher who experienced all three modalities, while three different research participants were assigned to each modality individually. Research participants and researchers completed surveys measuring workload and usability. Remote consenting allows researchers and participants to connect at their preferred location and time, and teleconsenting was found to be the preferred modality by the researchers, primarily due to its ability to exchange visual cues. However, challenges such as training requirements and technology dependence need to be addressed for widespread implementation. Future research should aim to eliminate these barriers and improve remote consenting modalities to facilitate clinical research participation.",

    "doi": "10.1016/j.apergo.2023.104141",
    "abstract": "Although resilient performance is intrinsic to socio-technical systems it might be supported by design, an idea known as Design for Resilient Performance (DfRP). Considering that such design is usually a re-design, learning from existing systems is crucial. This article introduces a framework for assessing the extent to which a system uses practices and principles of DfRP. The framework allows for the assessment of 24 attributes of the principles, the analysis of their relationships (a model was devised based on a survey with experts), and the investigation of practices that operationalize the principles. A scoring system sheds light on the effectiveness of using the principles. The framework application is exemplified based on the study of an emergency department in which daily huddles stood out as a practice of DfRP. This study involved interviews, observations, and documentary analysis. Based on this, a knowledge structure of DfRP is presented, comprised of concepts, principles, and practices. Six propositions to guide the framework application are set out, addressing themes such as the need for cost-effective DfRP, short control cycles, and customized designs that meet preferences of designers. The study contributes to DfRP theory and offers a new approach for resilience assessment.",

    "doi": "10.1016/j.apergo.2023.104152",
    "abstract": "Onboard virtual assistants with the ability to converse with users are gaining favour in supporting effective human-machine interaction to meet safe standards of operation in automated vehicles (AVs). Previous studies have highlighted the need to communicate situation information to effectively support the transfer of control and responsibility of the driving task. This study explores ‘interaction types’ used for this complex human-machine transaction, by analysing how situation information is conveyed and reciprocated during a transfer of control scenario. Two human drivers alternated control in a bespoke, dual controlled driving simulator with the transfer of control being entirely reliant on verbal communication. Handover dialogues were coded based on speech-act classifications, and a cluster analysis was conducted. Four interaction types were identified for both virtual assistants (i.e., agent handing over control) - Supervisor, Information Desk, Interrogator and Converser, and drivers (i.e., agent taking control) - Coordinator, Perceiver, Inquirer and Silent Receiver. Each interaction type provides a framework of characteristics that can be used to define driver requirements and implemented in the design of future virtual assistants to support the driver in maintaining and rebuilding timely situation awareness, whilst ensuring a positive user experience. This study also provides additional insight into the role of dialogue turns and takeover time and provides recommendations for future virtual assistant designs in AVs.",

    "abstract": "New production vehicles equipped with multiple screens have various functions and technologies at the user's fingertips that create informative and immersive cockpits not only for the driver but also for the passenger. Despite the growing popularity of the co-pilot display, surprisingly little is known about the impact of its engagement on drivers. Engagement, in the context of this paper, is defined as visual, auditory, and mental involvement but no manual involvement. The present study sought to investigate the effects of co-pilot display engagement on drivers' visual workload, cognitive workload, and driving performance and offered a deeper insight into the design factors and task involvement of the co-pilot display. The study involved a driving simulator testing of 25 participants in five automobiles with a co-pilot display. Our analysis found increased driver visual workload and cognitive workload in the conditions of co-pilot display engagement. Participants exhibited more erratic driving behavior (standard deviation of speed and standard deviation of lane position) while the front passenger was watching a video. Furthermore, five linear mixed models were built to further analyze the effects of task type, screen size, screen layout, and task involvement on dependent measures. Potential applications of this research include refinements to the co-pilot display and workload estimation of co-pilot display engagement.",

    "doi": "10.1016/j.apergo.2023.104153",
    "abstract": "Many fatal motorcycle accidents occur because car drivers infringe on motorcycle riders' right-of-way. The size-arrival effect refers to observers' tendency to judge larger objects as arriving sooner than smaller objects when estimating an approaching object's arrival time, which is one cause of right-of-way motorcycle accidents. Previous research has focused on a single vehicle that approaches the driver. However, it is also possible that a motorcycle approaches a driver along with other vehicles driving on multiple-lane roads. This paper presents the results of two online experiments; Experiment 1 validated the size-arrival effect when either a car or a motorcycle approached a driver waiting to turn across an intersection; and Experiment 2 investigated the size-arrival effect when a motorcycle and a parallelly driven car simultaneously approached the driver. Participants (n = 1723) in Experiment 1 and (n = 986) in Experiment 2 took part in the study. The results (1) validated the size-arrival effect; drivers accepted a smaller gap for approaching motorcycles than cars; (2) in the present settings drivers made turn decisions based on the distance gap rather than the time-to-arrival gap; (3) driver's acceptance of the gap when facing a motorcycle and a car was comparable to when facing only the car and significantly larger than facing only a motorcycle. These findings indicate that a car driving parallelly or behind a motorcycle reduces the size-arrival effect. These findings provide implications to suggest a safe riding strategy for motorcycle riders. We also suggest that such online experiments would facilitate studying large samples with less effort.",

    "abstract": "Prevention of musculoskeletal occupational hazards is an important topic in extractive industries. This study quantifies the impact of three styles of industrial metacarpal gloves on dexterity, gripping, pinching, and torquing tasks. Results indicated that wearing metacarpal gloves duplicated the time to complete a dexterity task from an average of 57 s for bare hands to 127 s for gloved hands. The highest drop in gripping force occurred while wearing a thicker glove, while gloves with thinner palmar sides produced smaller but similar force reductions of around 6%. The highest pinching force was obtained while wearing the thinnest glove, with a rise of 15%. Self-perception of exertion while wearing gloves varied between genders. Given that dexterity, grip, and pinch strength outcomes varied based on glove materials, the authors propose a new hand safety concept model to promote a multi-factorial approach to balance the risks and benefits of prospective personal protective equipment.",

    "doi": "10.1016/j.apergo.2023.104130",
    "abstract": "The increasingly ubiquitous use of smartphones has made distracted walking common, not only on flat ground, but also on stairs. Available information regarding changes in gait performance while walking and using a smartphone in different environments is still lacking. We aimed to investigate the differences in gait behavior and subjective walking confidence while walking up and down stairs and escalators, with and without smartphone use. A field experiment involving 32 female adults was conducted at a subway station. Gait parameters collected included step frequency, acceleration root mean square, step variability, step regularity, and step symmetry. The results showed that walking task, walking environment, and walking direction significantly affected gait performance and walking confidence. Overall, playing games or texting while walking down escalators resulted in the lowest walking confidence and the largest gait performance decrement: slower step frequency; reduced root mean square; decreased step regularity and step symmetry; and increased step variability. Step frequency, step variability, and step regularity significantly correlated with walking confidence. Smartphone use while walking on stairs and escalators significantly affects gait behavior and might increase the risk of falls. Interventions and prevention are needed to increase safety education and hazard warnings for the general population.",

    "abstract": "A factor that can potentially negatively impact the accuracy of automated decision aid use, and increase perceived workload, is time pressure. Increased automation transparency can increase the accuracy of automation use. We examined the extent to which increased transparency can mitigate the negative effects of time pressure on the accuracy of automation use and perceived workload. Participants completed an uninhabited vehicle (UV) management task where they assigned the best UV to complete missions by either accepting or rejecting automated advice. Participants made a decision after either 25s (low time pressure) or 12s (high time pressure). The accuracy of automation use decreased, and perceived workload increased, when under higher time pressure. Higher transparency benefited the accuracy of automation use and increased perceived trust and usability. However, high transparency did not mitigate the negative impacts of high time pressure, indicating that increased time pressure can influence the processing of highly transparent information.",

    "abstract": "Production workers suffer from musculoskeletal disorders (MSDs) due to excessive workloads that exceed the individual physical capabilities. In order to assess and subsequently reduce the risk to suffer from a MSD at a specific workplace, companies use ergonomic screening methods. However, the current approaches have two major downsides: Firstly, they do not take the individual worker and his/her capabilities into account. Applied thresholds for joint angles or physical loads are standard values that do not address physical limitations, such as age-related loss of flexibility or muscle strength. Secondly, the methods only provide a risk assessment that indicates which workplaces and/or working postures are ergonomically hazardous. Necessary workplace improvements are decoupled from the results and require extensive ergonomic knowledge. This paper presents a method that uses an individualized ergonomics analysis to improve workplaces according to individual needs and helps the industrial engineer to find necessary workplace improvements.",

    "doi": "10.1016/j.apergo.2023.104124",
    "abstract": "This study uses Digital Human Modelling (DHM) and Discrete Event Simulation (DES) to examine how caring for COVID-19-positive (C+) patients affects nurses' workload and care-quality. DHM inputs include: nurse anthropometrics, task postures, and hand forces. DES inputs include: unit-layout, patient care data, COVID-19 status & impact on tasks, and task execution-logic. The study shows that reducing nurses' biomechanical workload increases mental workload and decreases direct patient care, potentially leading to stress, burnout, and errors. Compared to pre-pandemic conditions, when nurses were assigned five C+ patients, cumulative bilateral shoulder moments and lumbar load decreased by 38%, 36%, and 46%, respectively. However, this was accompanied by increases in mental workload (242%), task waiting-time (70%), and missed-care (353%). These effects were driven by the large increase in required infection control routines. Combining DHM and DES can help evaluate workplace/task designs and provide valuable insights for healthcare system design-policy setting and operational management decision-making.",

    "abstract": "We examined the impact of sharing periscope imagery and analysis tools in eighteen five-member teams (Sonar, Periscope, 2xTrack Motion Analysts, Track Manager) who undertook simulated submarine patrol tasks. Compared to a baseline condition, sharing imagery to team members increased perceived individual workload, with no improvement to team performance (tactical picture accuracy). When both imagery and analysis tools were shared, perceived workload increased and tactical picture compilation was more accurate. Despite this improved tactical picture for the imagery and analysis tools condition, there was no advantage to mission completion (rendezvous/close contact detection) or situation awareness. In contrast to the increased subjective workload, individuals in teams provided with shared imagery (with or without tools) had a lower physiological response (heart rate, electrodermal) to task demands compared to the baseline condition. Sharing imagery and analysis tools likely benefited tactical picture compilation by enabling dynamic task redistribution and multiple streams of concurrent data analysis.",

Here, we examined the effect of microclimate temperature (MCT; i.e., the air between headset and user) and the effect of standing and seated use on thermal discomfort for a goggle style headset. Users played VR games across three 48-min sessions with different thermal profiles ranging between 28°–43 °C. Perceived thermal and weight discomfort were rated by participants every 12-min. Thermal, but not weight comfort declined during the study period as MCT increased. Users sweat more and had greater forehead temperatures while standing with the lowest thermal profile, suggesting thermal management is more critical for active experiences. Overall, this study recommends MCT should be kept below 36 °C. Finally design for thermal comfort should be tailored to the individual, experience duration and activity level.",

PubMed, CINAHL, Scopus, Web of Science and the Cochrane library were searched. A total of 4637 records were identified and screened. Thirty-three papers were included in the review. Participant characteristics, load carriage conditions, study protocol, outcome measures and main findings were extracted and qualitatively synthesised. Absolute oxygen uptake and minute ventilation were consistently greater in males but there were limited sex-specific differences when these were expressed relative to physical characteristics. There is limited evidence of sex-specific differences in spatio-temporal variables, ground reaction forces (normalised to body mass) or sagittal plane joint angles with load. However, differences have been found in hip and pelvic motions in the frontal and horizontal planes, which might partly explain an economical advantage for females proposed by some authors.",

    "abstract": "Marksmanship is a foundational Soldier skill required for all active-duty military personnel regardless of duty position. This research compared shooting performance and underlying postural mechanics of Expert and Novice marksmen during a dynamic, live-fire shooting task. Eighteen military personnel volunteered to participate in this study (n = 9 Experts and n = 9 Novices). All participants completed the dynamic marksmanship task with an M4 carbine under each of two equipment conditions: (I) a No Load Condition (6 kg) and (II) a Loaded Condition (31 kg) using standard-issue military equipment. Marksmanship performance was assessed using lethality measures including total hits and course efficiency. Postural mechanics were collected via body- and weapon-mounted inertial measurement units (IMUs). Significant differences (p < 0.05) in shooting performance and course efficiency were found between Expert and Novice marksmen for both load conditions. Significant differences were also found in postural movement patterns between Expert and Novice marksmen utilizing IMU-derived performance measures, especially when transitioning between targets, though these findings were not always consistent across load conditions. Based on these results, training interventions that focus on target acquisition, increasing torso stability, and maximizing the linkage between the torso and weapon could be recommended to improve performance in Novice marksmen.",

    "abstract": "Objectives The present study analyzed changes in palmar hand measurements during power grip by wrist radial/ulnar deviation for an ergonomic grip design. Method Twelve palmar dimensions (Tip-to-PTC/DTC distances, Tip-to-MMC distances, and Tip-to-MMC surface lengths) of digits 2 to 5 were measured for 30 Koreans with various hand sizes (15 males and 15 females; hand length = 177.9 ± 12.3 mm) at three wrist postures (neutral, 20° of radial deviation, and 30° of ulnar deviation) using 3D scanning and casting methods. Results As the hand changed from the straight neutral posture to the power grip posture, the Tip-to-PTC/DTC distances (related to grip widths), Tip-to-MMC distances (related to grip heights), and Tip-to-MMC surface lengths (related to grip circumferences) decreased to 30%–65% compared to corresponding original lengths. Wrist posture also had significant effects on the Tip-to-PTC/DTC and Tip-to-MMC distances by 6.5%–9.0%, while finger position significantly affected all the measurements by 8.2%–22.3%. Practitioner summary The measurement protocol of palmar hand dimensions and the changes in palmar hand measurements by wrist posture are of use to develop an ergonomic handle design for comfort and prevention of musculoskeletal disorders.",

    "abstract": "Hospital wayfinding systems that are based solely on signage do not provide adequate solutions for wayfinding needs, especially for users with impairments. Moreover, the interaction between user characteristics and the inner space of the building also determines wayfinding efficiency. The aims of this study, therefore, were to identify architectural features that affect spatial orientation and wayfinding behaviors; demonstrate the implementation of a multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) approach for improving wayfinding in a diverse range of users; and produce a set of quantitative values (i.e., weights) for each selected architectural feature, based on the individual's preferences. Doing so could enable the formulating of practical design guidelines for hospital buildings, tailored to the needs and abilities of the users, to minimize disorientation and confusion – as demonstrated in this paper through a case study. The MCDM approach was chosen as it is based on observations whereby wayfinding resembles a continuous decision-making process, throughout which, users continuously select those architectural features that they perceive as having the greatest wayfinding value.",

    "abstract": "Studies indicate that verbal instructions may impact associations between gender and wayfinding performance (measured via relative direction pointing accuracy and walking pace). Following the increasing use of digital navigation applications in indoor environments, and their implications on acquiring and processing spatial information, the aim of this study is to evaluate the stability of previously established associations. The study included 34 participants (16 females) aged 24–34 and was conducted in an indoor hospital setting. In addition to using a navigation application, one of three types of verbal instructions (route, survey, or none) were given in each wayfinding scenario. Self-reported wayfinding strategies were also assessed. The findings indicate that male participants made fewer pointing accuracy errors and walked faster than females, regardless of the type of instructions given, implying that the impact of naturally employed wayfinding strategies by gender (route for females; survey for males) on wayfinding performance may be more dominant than that of navigational devices. In addition, when males and females were exposed to their unnatural wayfinding strategy, no significant differences were seen in either group's self-reported wayfinding strategies. These findings may suggest that applying survey knowledge to females may improve their indoor wayfinding.",

    "doi": "10.1016/j.apergo.2023.104126",
    "abstract": "Subjective scales are frequently used in the design process of head-related products to assess pressure discomfort. Nevertheless, some users lack fundamental cognitive and motor abilities (e.g., paralyzed patients). Therefore, it is vital to find non-verbal measurements of pressure discomfort and pressure pain. This study gathered the autonomic response data (heart rate and skin conductance) of 30 landmarks in head, neck and face from 31 participants experiencing pressure discomfort and pressure pain. The results indicate that pressure stimulation can change heart rate (HR) and skin conductance (SC). SC can be more useful in assessing pressure discomfort than HR for specific landmarks, and SC also possesses a faster arousal rate than HR. Moreover, HR decreased in response to pressure stimulation, while SC decreased followed by an increase. In comparisons between genders, the subjective pressure discomfort threshold (PDT) and pressure pain threshold (PPT) of women were lower than those of men, but men's autonomic responses (HR and SC) were more intense. Furthermore, there was no linear correlation between subjective pressure thresholds (PDT and PPT) and autonomic response intensity. This study has significant implications for resolving ergonomic issues (pressure discomfort and pain) associated with head-related products.",

    "doi": "10.1016/j.apergo.2023.104133",
    "abstract": "Background Understanding upper extremity strength symmetry can have important implications for ergonomics assessment and design. Few studies have examined isometric joint strength symmetry of left-handed individuals, or examined how handedness can influence strength. As such, the purpose of this study was to investigate the influence of handedness on dominant/non-dominant (D/ND) strength ratio in several moment directions about the shoulder, elbow, wrist, and hand. It was hypothesized that the isometric strength symmetry of left-handed individuals would be significantly different from that of right-handed individuals. Methods The study recruited 28 participants to perform a series of maximal voluntary isometric contractions (MVCs) with both arms for various efforts about the shoulder, elbow, and wrist, as well as handgrip for a total of 68 MVCs. Strength symmetry ratios were computed, and a two-way mixed-model ANOVA evaluated the effects of handedness and MVC test on strength symmetry. Interpretation Significant differences in D/ND ratios between right and left-handed individuals were found for 11 of the 17 explored exertion directions. Left-handed individuals tended to possess greater strength in their non-dominant limb, while right-handed individuals tended to have greater strength in their dominant limb. Left- and right-handed individuals often significantly differed in D/ND ratio, suggesting that separate normative values should be created to account for handedness when considering return-to-work or strength-based ergonomics design criterion.",

    "abstract": "Distracted driving remains a significant cause of traffic accidents globally, including in Australia. However, many younger drivers still admit to using a phone while driving. A simulated driving study investigated the neurophysiological effects of visual, auditory, and higher-order cognitive (i.e., requiring the use of executive functions) distraction on young drivers. In total, 24 young adults aged 18–25 years completed four 8 min simulated driving sessions while concurrently engaging in various distractor tasks. Neurophysiological arousal was measured via EEG. Additionally, subjective workload and objective driving performance were assessed. Frontal beta and gamma power exhibited their highest levels during tasks involving higher-order cognitive and visual demands. The higher-order cognitive condition was rated as the most mentally demanding. In comparison, the visual condition had the most significant impact on both the standard deviation of speed and standard deviation of lateral positioning. This study has significant implications for all road users, particularly those aged 18–25 years, and it reinforces the importance of not using a phone while driving.",
