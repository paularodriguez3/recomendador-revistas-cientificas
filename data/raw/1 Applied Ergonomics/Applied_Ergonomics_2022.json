    "abstract": "Computed Tomography (CT) is increasingly used in screening of cabin baggage in airports. The current study aimed to establish whether screening with CT confers a detection advantage over dual-view (DV) X-ray when resolution is controlled. We also evaluated whether a ‘targetless’ search strategy – in which screeners identify and reject safe items – improved detection relative to target-based methods. In an online study, 104 novice screeners were trained with either CT or DV, and either a targetless or a target-based search strategy. Screeners were then tested in a simulated cabin baggage screening task. CT screeners performed with greater sensitivity than DV screeners. Search strategy did not affect sensitivity, although the target-based strategy resulted in a more liberal criterion. We conclude that CT imaging confers a benefit to screening performance over DV when image resolution is controlled. This is likely due to the ability to rotate the image to resolve occlusions.",

    "abstract": "This paper systematically reviews 20 years of publications (N = 54) on aviation and neurophysiology. The main goal is to provide an account of neurophysiological changes associated with flight training with the aim of identifying neurometrics indicative of pilot's flight training level and task relevant mental states, as well as to capture the current state-of-art of (neuro)ergonomic design and practice in flight training. We identified multiple candidate neurometrics of training progress and workload, such as frontal theta power, the EEG Engagement Index and the Cognitive Stability Index. Furthermore, we discovered that several types of classifiers could be used to accurately detect mental states, such as the detection of drowsiness and mental fatigue. The paper advances practical guidelines on terminology usage, simulator fidelity, and multimodality, as well as future research ideas including the potential of Virtual Reality flight simulations for training, and a brain-computer interface for flight training.",

    "abstract": "Human factors research can play an important role in the successful design of infrastructure to support future mobility. Through engaging users and stakeholders early in the design process we can gain insights before the physical environments are built. This paper presents data from a truly novel application of Virtual Reality (VR), where user experience and wayfinding were evaluated within an emerging future transport infrastructure to support urban air mobility (UAM) – the urban airport (aka vertiports). Urban airports are located in city centres where drones or ‘flying cars’ would land and take off from. Previous quantitative studies have investigated passenger experience in traditional airports using field observation and surveys, but this paper is the first to present qualitative research on user experience in this emerging mobility infrastructure using an immersive VR environment. Twenty participants completed a series of six scenarios aimed at understanding customer ‘exciters’ and ‘pain points’ within an urban airport. Results and recommendations from this empirical research will help inform the design of all future mobility infrastructure solutions, through improving user experience before the infrastructure is physically deployed. Finally, this paper highlights the benefits of engaging users at an early stage of the design process to ensure that future transport infrastructure will be accessible, easy to navigate and a pleasure to use.",

It is essential to understand the inherent risks associated with the nature of this occupation. Based on the Balance Theory (Smith & Carayon-Sainfort, 1989), this review surveys the current literature, especially those published since the previous review paper (Kumar & Kumar, 2008), and identifies which elements contributing to MSD risks were examined: task, technology, organization, environment, individual, and their interactions. Thirty-nine research papers published between 2005 and 2021 are identified and summarized. Among these papers, task and individual elements received the most attention, at 42 and 34 occurrences, respectively. The interaction elements of technology-organization, technology-environment, and organization-environment received less than three mentions. The goal of this literature review is to update the knowledge base and identify current trends for the cleaning occupation. Possible interventions for risk reduction and future research directions are suggested.",

    "abstract": "In electric buses, the heating, ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC) system is responsible for up to 50% of the energy consumption, thereby significantly affecting the efficiency. It is therefore necessary to identify improved thermal settings for the bus cabin to minimize the energy consumption, while guaranteeing good thermal comfort. To achieve this goal, this paper presents the results of climatic measurements in an electric bus in Berlin, Germany. These measurements were performed for outer temperatures between 5.3 °C and 7.8 °C and four cabin temperature settings. During the measurements, several climatic parameters and the energy consumption were measured, whereas the thermal comfort (TC) was evaluated via 71 passengers’ surveys. The results show that the climatic conditions in the bus vary greatly depending on the position (up to 3 K difference in mean air temperature) and height (up to 8 K/m temperature-to-height ratio). Additionally, the surveys show that the mean value of the thermal comfort parameter TC is minimized to a value of 0.15 (corresponding to “comfortable” thermal perception) for a set temperature of 21 °C, whereas the thermal conditions are perceived as acceptable even with heating off.",

Industry 4.0 aims to achieve the real-time assessment of the workers’ condition to adapt processes including the current mental workload. Mental workload can be assessed via physiological data. This paper researches the potential of wearable devices for mental workload assessment by utilizing heart rate and motion data collected with a smartwatch. A laboratory study was conducted with four levels of mental workload, ranging from none to high and during sitting and stepping activities. When sitting, a difference in the heart rate and motion data from the smartwatch was only found between no mental workload and any mental workload task. For the stepping condition, differences were found for the movement data. Based on these results, wearable devices could be useful in the future for detecting whether a mental demanding task is currently performed during low levels of physical activity.",

Previous studies have found this constellation of work conditions leads to high stress levels. This study investigated the relationships among job demand-control-support, burnout, and musculoskeletal symptoms for commercial janitors in Washington State. Structural equation modeling was performed using data from 208 participants with analyses comparing models of daytime and nighttime janitors. Burnout fully mediated the relationship between job demands and musculoskeletal complaints among daytime janitors. Among nighttime janitors, burnout mediated between job demands, job control, and social support, and musculoskeletal complaints. The nighttime janitors' model was more fully supported compared to the daytime model. This study is one of a small number that examine and bring attention to the importance of janitors’ burnout. Recommendations to improve the psychosocial work environment toward mitigating burnout and reducing musculoskeletal complaints are provided.",

    "doi": "10.1016/j.apergo.2022.103825",
    "abstract": "Automated vehicles (AVs) can perform low-level control tasks but are not always capable of proper decision-making. This paper presents a concept of eye-based maneuver control for AV-pedestrian interaction. Previously, it was unknown whether the AV should conduct a stopping maneuver when the driver looks at the pedestrian or looks away from the pedestrian. A two-agent experiment was conducted using two head-mounted displays with integrated eye-tracking. Seventeen pairs of participants (pedestrian and driver) each interacted in a road crossing scenario. The pedestrians' task was to hold a button when they felt safe to cross the road, and the drivers' task was to direct their gaze according to instructions. Participants completed three 16-trial blocks: (1) Baseline, in which the AV was pre-programmed to yield or not yield, (2) Look to Yield (LTY), in which the AV yielded when the driver looked at the pedestrian, and (3) Look Away to Yield (LATY), in which the AV yielded when the driver did not look at the pedestrian. The driver's eye movements in the LTY and LATY conditions were visualized using a virtual light beam. Crossing performance was assessed based on whether the pedestrian held the button when the AV yielded and released the button when the AV did not yield. Furthermore, the pedestrians' and drivers' acceptance of the mappings was measured through a questionnaire. The results showed that the LTY and LATY mappings yielded better crossing performance than Baseline. Furthermore, the LTY condition was best accepted by drivers and pedestrians. Eye-tracking analyses indicated that the LTY and LATY mappings attracted the pedestrian's attention, while pedestrians still distributed their attention between the AV and a second vehicle approaching from the other direction. In conclusion, LTY control may be a promising means of AV control at intersections before full automation is technologically feasible.",

Full-workday recordings from accelerometers and IMUs of arm and trunk postures and movements from 38 warehouse workers were used to develop 4 angular (posture) and 24 angular velocity (movement) conversion models for the distributions of the data. A power function with one coefficient and one exponent was used, and it correlated well (r2 > 0.999) in all cases to the average curves comparing one measurement with another. These conversion models facilitate the comparison and merging of measurements of arm and trunk movements collected using the two sensor types and the two computational methods.",

    "abstract": "Excessive physical demand at work has traditionally been connected with adverse health outcomes, but excessive sitting is now also being recognised as an occupational hazard and emerging work-related risk. Traditional preventive occupational health and ergonomics programs are useful but limited through reliance on individual behaviour change and time-diversion from productive work. A new ‘Goldilocks Work Paradigm’ aims to optimise health and productivity by using movements of productive tasks. Using rail driving as a specific case of a highly sedentary and inflexible working environment, we construct a conceptual framework for designing better jobs, arguing that a theoretical amalgamation of the new Goldilocks Work Paradigm with System Thinking, Participatory Ergonomics, and a Risk Management Framework, is needed, for establishing a unified, strategic approach—a ‘just right’ job design model. We extend this by outlining a practical process of designing better jobs with tools that can be used to achieve it.",

    "abstract": "Human perception of automation reliability and automation acceptance behaviours are key to effective human-automation teaming. This study examined factors that impact perceptions of automation reliability over time and the acceptance of automated advice. Participants completed a maritime vessel classification task in which they classified vessels (contacts) with the assistance of automation. In Experiment 1 automation reliability successively switched from high to low (or vice versa). In Experiment 2 automation reliability decreased by varying magnitudes before returning to high. Participants did not initially calibrate to true reliability and experiencing low automation reliability reduced future reliability estimates when experiencing subsequent high reliability. Automation acceptance was predicted by positive differences between participant perception of automation reliability and confidence in their own manual classification reliability. Experiencing low automation reliability caused perceptions of reliability and automation acceptance rates to diverge. These findings have important implications for training and adaptive human-automation teaming in complex work environments.",

    "abstract": "Multimodal interaction (MMI) is being widely implemented, especially in new technologies such as augmented reality (AR) systems since it is presumed to support a more natural, efficient, and flexible form of interaction. However, limited research has been done to investigate the proper application of MMI in AR. More specifically, the effects of combining different input and output modalities during MMI in AR are still not fully understood. Therefore, this study aims to examine the independent and combined effects of different input and output modalities during a typical AR task. 20 young adults participated in a controlled experiment in which they were asked to perform a simple identification task using an AR device in different input (speech, gesture, multimodal) and output (VV-VA, VV-NA, NV-VA, NV-NA) conditions. Results showed that there were differences in the influence of input and output modalities on task performance, workload, perceived appropriateness, and user preference. Interaction effects between the input and output conditions on the performance metrics were also evident in this study, suggesting that although multimodal input is generally preferred by the users, it should be implemented with caution since its effectiveness is highly influenced by the processing code of the system output. This study, which is the first of its kind, has revealed several new implications regarding the application of MMI in AR systems.",

    "doi": "10.1016/j.apergo.2022.103833",
    "abstract": "3D gestural technology for HCI could transform the way people interact with computing systems. There are traditionally two approaches to developing gestural technology systems: a human-based approach where usability is maximized and a technology-based approach where system accuracy is maximized. The tradeoff between usability and accuracy may negatively affect the overall trust and reliability in the system. Therefore, this study seeks to redefine the human-based approach to gestural system development by introducing a bottom-up approach to identifying the lower-level features that produce a gesture, thus allowing the technology to accurately recognize features. A user elicitation study was performed, and gestures were classified according to a novel feature extraction gesture taxonomy and a traditional taxonomy of classifying gestures as a unit. The feature-extraction approach revealed several advantages because it fosters a bottom-up approach to identifying gesture features. Using this approach may mitigate the effects of the usability-accuracy tradeoff in gestural system development.",

To understand how these workers’ PA were affected throughout the pandemic, PA data collected in January, April, June, and December 2020 with an activity tracker and a validated survey were analyzed. Between January and December, it was found that step counts during the weekday decreased (p < 0.01), weekday heart rate was higher than weekends (p < 0.01), activity-tracker and self-reported PA decreased (p < 0.01), and sitting time increased (p < 0.01). To understand the agreement between the objective and subjective METs, Bland-Altman analyses were completed and demonstrated an acceptable level of agreement. Findings show decreased level of PA amongst WFH office workers and that the activity tracker and survey are reliable methods of recording WFH PA.",

    "abstract": "The revolution of technologically advanced vehicles with a high level of automation involves a profound transformation. The focus of most research in this area has been on the use of travel time for different use cases. Sleeping is one of the most time-consuming activities in everyone's life; therefore, this has been described as one of the most desired use cases for fully automated vehicles. In order to identify the best conditions to allow sleep and improve sleep quality while travelling in such vehicles, two studies were performed: a sleep study and a pressure distribution study, the results of which are included in this document. The focus of both studies was on two seat positions: reclined (60° backrest recline) and flat (87° backrest recline). In the sleep study, forty participants had the opportunity to sleep during a 90-min drive in order to evaluate long-term comfort and subjective sleep quantity and quality. Although both positions resulted in generally similar results in terms of sleep and comfort, some significant differences were identified. Karolinska Sleepiness Scale results showed that sleepiness increased in the reclined position, whereas it decreased in the flat position. Moreover, the self-reported parameter Wake After Sleep Onset was higher in the reclined position. In the pressure distribution study, it was possible to identify specific seat prototype limitations indicating inadequate support, which was related to discomfort detected during the sleep study. As a conclusion, the comparison between the reclined and flat positions showed indications that, in moving fully automated vehicles, the flat seat position is the most comfortable and effective for sleeping.",

    "abstract": "Objective To assess whether the capacity to utilize cues amongst emergency physicians is associated with differences in the capacity to recover performance following an interruption. Background Interruptions are implicated in errors in emergency medicine due to the cognitive load that they impose on working memory, resulting in a loss of performance on the primary task. The utilization of cues is associated with a reduction in cognitive load during the performance of a task, thereby enabling the allocation of residual resources that mitigates the loss of performance following interruptions. Method Thirty-nine emergency physicians, recruited at a medical conference, completed an assessment of cue utilization (EXPERTise 2.0) and an online simulation (Septris) that involved the management of patients presenting with sepsis. During the simulation, physicians were interrupted and asked to check a medication order. Task performance was assessed using scores on Septris, with points awarded for the accurate management of patients. Results Emergency physicians with higher cue utilization recorded significantly higher scores on the simulation task following the interruption, compared to physicians with lower cue utilization (p = .028). Conclusion The results confirm a relationship between cue utilization and the recovery of performance following an interruption. This is likely due to the advantages afforded by associated reductions in cognitive load. Application Assessments of cue utilization may assist in the development of interventions to support clinicians in interruptive environments.",

Despite this, most load carriage research is performed on males. Peer reviewed articles were collected from four databases to summarize available research on biomechanical and physiological effects of load carriage on females in the military. Extraction and thematic analysis were performed on 18 articles. 39% looked at biomechanical differences between loads in females, 61% looked at how the same load affected males and females, 44% looked at sex-by-load interaction effects, and 72% discussed impacts of load on females. The research revealed that military load carriage affects the biomechanics and physiology differently in females and to a greater extent than in males. Several gaps in available literature were found. Very few studies used military participants, military equipment, and/or employed occupationally relevant data collection methodologies.",

    "abstract": "Psychological research demonstrates how our perceptions and cognitions are affected by context, motivation, expectation, and experience. A mounting body of research has revealed the many sources of bias that affect the judgments of experts as they execute their work. Professionals in such fields as forensic science, intelligence analysis, criminal investigation, medical and judicial decision-making find themselves at an inflection point where past professional practices are being questioned and new approaches developed. Workplace investigation is a professional domain that is in many ways analogous to the aforementioned decision-making environments. Yet, workplace investigation is also unique, as the sources, magnitude, and direction of bias are specific to workplace environments. The workplace investigation literature does not comprehensively address the many ways that the workings of honest investigators' minds may be biased when collecting evidence and/or rendering judgments; nor does the literature offer a set of strategies to address such happenings. The current paper is the first to offer a comprehensive overview of the important issue of cognitive bias in workplace investigation. In it I discuss the abilities and limitations of human cognition, provide a framework of sources of bias, as well as, offer suggestions for bias mitigation in the investigation process.",

    "abstract": "Human-robot collaboration (HRC) is an emerging research area that has gained tremendous attention in both academia and industry. Yet, the feature that humans and robots sharing the workplace has led to safety concerns. In particular, the mental stress or safety awareness of human teammates during HRC remains unclear but is also of great importance to workplace safety. In this manuscript, we reviewed twenty-five studies for understanding the relationships between HRC and workers' mental stress or safety awareness. Specifically, we aimed to understand: (1) robot-related factors that may affect human workers' mental stress or safety awareness, (2) a number of measurements that could be used to evaluate workers' mental stress in HRC, and (3) various methods for measuring safety awareness that had been adopted or could be applied in HRC. According to our literature review, robot-related factors including robot characteristics, social touching and trajectory have relationships with workers’ mental stress or safety awareness. For the measurement of mental stress and safety awareness, each method mentioned has its validity and rationality. Additionally, a discussion related to the potential co-robot actions to lower mental stress or improve safety awareness as well as future implications were provided.",

Four scan-based metrics were significant predictors across the different growth curve models of response time and accuracy. Stationary gaze entropy (a measure of how dispersed visual attention transitions are across tasks) was predictive across all three transition rates. The other three predictive scan-based metrics captured different aspects of visual attention, including its spread, directness, and duration. The findings specify several missing details in both theory and design guidance, which is unprecedented, and serves as a basis of future workload transition research.",

    "abstract": "This qualitative study aims to identify challenges, needs and gaps for home care bathroom tasks and gather information that will allow for user-centered, sustainable solutions for home care in the bathroom. Twenty-one interviews were carried out with participants with the perspective of client, health care worker or care organization. The data were analyzed using qualitative content analysis and interpretive description. The findings identify important factors for enabling both independent living for clients and a sustainable work environment for the health care workers. They include adequate space, access to assistive devices and regular risk assessments to recognize changing needs. Enabling independent living is one strategy that can be used to manage the ongoing demographic change as well as the expected future labor shortage in the care sector. Changes can be made in the physical environment (the residential bathroom) in order to facilitate safer task performance for both the clients and the health care workers.",

    "abstract": "Using traditional back tables (BT) in operating rooms (OR) can lead to high physical/cognitive demand on nurses due to repetitive manual material handling activities. A multi-tier table (MTT) has been developed to relieve such stressors by providing extra working surfaces to avoid stacking the instrument trays and facilitate access to surgical tools. In this study, sixteen participants performed lifting/lowering and instrument findings tasks on each table, where kinematics, kinetics, subjective, and performance-related measures were recorded. Results indicated that MTT required lesser shoulder flexion (p-value<0.001), ∼14% lower shoulder loads (0.012), task completion time (<0.001), and cognitive/physical workloads (<0.004). Although peak low-back demands were ∼15% higher using MTT, the number of lifts to complete the same task was 60% lower, leading to lower cumulative demand on the low-back musculature. Utilizing MTT in OR could reduce demand and increase nurses' efficiency, leading to reduced risk of WMSDs and the total time of surgery.",

    "doi": "10.1016/j.apergo.2022.103820",
    "abstract": "Society relies upon informal (family, friend) caregivers to provide much of the care to the estimated 43.8 million individuals living with Alzheimer's disease and related dementias globally. Caregivers rarely receive sufficient training, resources, or support to meet the demands associated with dementia care, which is often associated with increased risk of suboptimal outcomes. Human factors and ergonomics (HFE) can address the call for new approaches to better understand caregiving and support caregiver performance through systematic attention to and design of systems that support the work of caregivers– their care work. Thus, our objective was to perform a work system analysis of care work. We conducted a qualitative study using a Critical Incident Technique interviewing approach and Grounded Dimensional Analysis analytic procedures. Our findings introduce a new conceptual framework for understanding the care work system of dementia caregivers and suggest that care work is influenced by interactions among distinct caregiver goals, the task demands of the care needs of the person with dementia, daily life needs of the caregiver and family, and contextual factors that shape caregivers' perceptions surrounding care. The initial work system model produced by this study provides a foundation from which future work can further elucidate the care work system, determine how the care work system intersects and coordinates with other work systems such as the patient work system, and design systems that address caregivers' individual caregiving context.",

A systematic literature review was conducted in March 2021 using Compendex, Google Scholar, Web of Science, and Scopus databases. Forty-five studies met the inclusion criteria. A meta-analysis was conducted and Cochrane risk of bias tool and Cochran's Q test were used to assess risk of bias and homogeneity of the effect sizes respectively. Results suggested that drivers exhibited safer performance when dealing with critical incidents in manual driving than partially automated driving (PAD) and highly automated driving (HAD) conditions. However, drivers reported higher workload in the manual driving mode as compared to the HAD and PAD conditions. Haptic, auditory, and visual-auditory takeover request modalities are preferred over the visual-only modality to improve takeover time. Use of handheld NDRTs significantly degraded driver performance as compared to NDRTs performed on mounted devices.",

This study assessed utilization of passive shoulder exoskeletons on shoulder and torso muscle activation during simulated squeeze riveting. Horizontal and vertical riveting tasks using squeeze riveting tools were performed by 16 aircraft workers wearing three different shoulder exoskeletons and a no-exoskeleton condition capturing electromyographic signals from shoulder and torso muscles. Exoskeletons reduced normalized EMG for the left anterior deltoid at both heights (6.6% and 15.7%), the right anterior deltoid (8.3%) and the right and left medial deltoid (9.3% and 8.9%) at the upper height for horizontal squeeze riveting. Exoskeletons reduced normalized EMG for the right and left anterior deltoids (7.0%–10.6%) and medial deltoids (1.3%–7.1%) within the upper zones during vertical squeeze riveting. Participants felt exoskeletons would be beneficial for squeeze riveting, however no preference was found among the exoskeletons used.",

Current studies introduced a newly-developed Standing and Walking Visual Attention Field (SWAVF) task to assess visuospatial attention during walking and examined its reliability, validity, and stability. Thirty young adults completed a traditional computerized Attention Visual Field (AVF) task while sitting, and the SWAVF task under walking and standing settings. Nine participants also performed the SWAVF task under additional distraction conditions. Results showed good split-half reliability during standing (r = 0.70) and walking (r = 0.69), moderate concurrent validity with the sitting AVF task (r = 0.42), moderate convergent validity between the standing and walking settings (r = 0.69), good construct validity, and moderate rank-order stability (r = 0.53). Overall, the SWAVF task showed good psychometric properties. Potential applications to the evaluation of prosthetic and other exoskeleton devices, smart glasses, and ground-level traffic lights or signs were discussed.",

Maritime pilots control most pilotage operations worldwide, yet despite the safety criticality of their role, research examining pilot decision-making processes during these complex and dynamic operations is scarce. This article describes the findings from two studies that utilised an integrated systems thinking framework to understand how pilots make decisions and what factors are perceived to influence their decisions. Interviews were held with 22 pilots (Study 1) and 17 maritime safety stakeholders (Study 2) in the New Zealand maritime context. The findings illustrate the challenges pilots face during pilotage and provide insights into their decision-making processes and the systemic factors that can be addressed to improve maritime safety. Given the multiple causal pathways to incidents occurring during pilotage identified by this research, it is suggested that multiple systems-wide interventions are needed, which is likely to require a long-term, strategic approach.",

    "abstract": "Adaptive capacity has been described as instrumental for the development of resilience in healthcare. Yet, our theoretical understanding of adaptive capacity remains relatively underdeveloped. This research therefore aims at developing a new understanding of the nature of adaptive capacity by exploring the following research questions: 1. What constitutes adaptive capacity across different healthcare contexts? and 2. What type of enabling factors support adaptive capacity across different healthcare contexts? The study used a novel combination of qualitative methods featuring a metasynthesis of narratives based on empirical research to contribute understanding of adaptive capacity across different healthcare contexts. The findings show that adaptive capacity was found to include four forms: reframing, aligning, coping, and innovating. A framework illustrating the relatedness between the identified forms, in terms of resources, change and enablers, is provided. Based on these findings, a new definition of adaptive capacity for resilience in healthcare is proposed.",

The current study evaluated upper extremity muscular loads associated with household floor vacuuming with the high CoM stick vacuum cleaners. Twenty participants conducted vacuuming on tiled and carpeted floors with straight and curved back-and-forth motions using medium (2.92 kg) and heavier weight (3.56 kg) cordless stick vacuums. The myoelectric signals of their upper extremity muscles were quantified during vacuuming. Mean normalized activity ranged from 8.2% to 20.2% of the maximum contraction capacity, with greater activity when vacuuming carpeted floors with a heavier vacuum cleaner. Study findings indicate that floor vacuuming with a cordless stick vacuum may not be as ergonomically efficient as assumed by their lighter weight. Instead, it is a physically demanding housekeeping activity that needs ergonomic attention.",

    "abstract": "This study aimed to investigate the effects of different tools and working heights on physical workloads in vertical cleaning tasks. Thirty healthy adults were recruited to use a rag and a long-handle tool (LHT) to simulate cleaning operations on the Wii Fit board surfaces of 3 different heights, respectively. Participants used a lower 50th percentile force but were required to spend a longer time to finish the task while using an LHT than using a rag. The tool preferences were the main factors considered for efficiency and personal subjective workload and physiological load. 76.6% of the participants preferred to use the LHT instead of the rag at a high task height, but 70% preferred to use the rag when working at a medium task height. For low workload cleaning tasks on vertical surfaces, employers should provide cleaners with different handle lengths tools to choose from to reduce the cleaner's workload.",

    "abstract": "Previously, we observed no significant reductions in sitting time of the multicomponent Dynamic Work (DW) intervention among office workers. In this study we used mixed-method data to understand context, implementation (i.e. recruitment and delivery) and mechanism of impact (i.e. experiences) of the DW intervention and to explore whether an higher implementation index score led to larger changes in participants’ outcomes. We found considerable variation across departments regarding context (i.e. different size and work tasks) and implementation (i.e. delivery varied). Satisfaction with the DW intervention was high. An higher implementation index score was associated with lower overall sitting time, lower occupational sitting time, higher number of steps/day and steps/day at work at 4-months, which was maintained at 8-month for occupational sitting time. These findings provide an understanding that implementation was affected by a lack of availability of intervention components, department policy, work tasks, positioning and work location.

    "abstract": "Passengers' travel behaviour is one of the significant factors affecting train overcrowding. Train occupancy information has been introduced as a tool to stimulate passengers' behaviour change to ease in-vehicle crowding. However, there are limitations to this strategy as it often fails to consider other elements in the complex rail system that influence behaviour. This research provides insights to service providers to promote passenger behaviour change by revealing the behavioural constraints in the environment. Cognitive Work Analysis (CWA) was applied to systematically analyse passengers’ behaviour and related constraints in the environment. Specifically, Work Domain Analysis (WDA) and Social Organisation and Cooperation Analysis (SOCA) were conducted and presented in the forms of Abstraction Hierarchy (AH) and Contextual Activity Template (CAT). Results showed that a wide range of informational, navigational and physical support alongside provision of occupancy information could better encourage passengers to select and use less busy carriages and trains. Behaviour change goals are likely to be achieved more effectively when the constraints of the system are better understood.",

    "abstract": "A new wheelchair tennis hand rim was developed, having a larger contact area and higher friction. How does this new hand rim compare to a regular hand rim regarding submaximal propulsion with a tennis racket during practice in novices? Twenty-four able-bodied novices (12 Regular Rim, 12 New Rim) completed a one-day experiment: pre-test, three practice-sessions and a post-test of 3 × 4 min each on a wheelchair ergometer (1.11 m/s, 7W). The New Rim group compared to the Regular Rim group, had a lower negative work per cycle (−0.83J vs. −2.06J, p = 0.01) at the post-test. There was a significantly larger increase in mechanical efficiency between the pre- and post-test in the New Rim group (2.3–3.4% vs. 2.1–2.5%, p = 0.02) compared to the Regular Rim group. The new rim led to a more ergonomic propulsion technique, with a reduction in negative power and higher mechanical efficiency between the pre- and post-test at submaximal propulsion.",

    "abstract": "Industry 4.0 is the concept used to summarize the ongoing fourth industrial revolution, which is profoundly changing the manufacturing systems and business models all over the world. Collaborative robotics is one of the most promising technologies of Industry 4.0. Human-robot interaction and human-robot collaboration will be crucial for enhancing the operator's work conditions and production performance. In this regard, this enabling technology opens new possibilities but also new challenges. There is no doubt that safety is of primary importance when humans and robots interact in industrial settings. Nevertheless, human factors and cognitive ergonomics (i.e. cognitive workload, usability, trust, acceptance, stress, frustration, perceived enjoyment) are crucial, even if they are often underestimated or ignored. Therefore, this work refers to cognitive ergonomics in the design of human-robot collaborative assembly systems. A set of design guidelines has been developed according to the analysis of the scientific literature. Their effectiveness has been evaluated through multiple experiments based on a laboratory case study where different participants interacted with a low-payload collaborative robotic system for the joint assembly of a manufacturing product. The main assumption to be tested is that it is possible to improve the operator's experience and efficiency by manipulating the system features and interaction patterns according to the proposed design guidelines. Results confirmed that participants improved their cognitive response to human-robot interaction as well as the assembly performance with the enhancement of workstation features and interaction conditions by implementing an increasing number of guidelines.",

    "abstract": "Misreading labels, syringes, and ampoules is reported to make up a 54.4% of medication administration errors. The addition of icons to medication labels in an operating room setting could add additional visual cues to the label, allowing for improved discrimination, visibility, and easily processed information that might reduce medication administration errors. A multi-disciplinary team proposed a method of enhancing visual cues and visibility of medication labels applied to vasoactive medication infusions by adding icons to the labels. Participants were 1.12 times more likely to correctly identify medications from farther away (p < 0.001, AOR = 1.12, 95% CI: 1.02, 1.22) with icons. When icons were present, participants were 2.16 times more likely to be more confident in their identifications (p < 0.001, AOR = 2.16, 95%CI: 1.80, 2.57). Carefully designed icons may offer an additional method for identifying medications, and thus reducing medication administration errors.",

    "abstract": "Background and aims Musculoskeletal (MSK) injuries among gastroenterologists are common. Our study describes risk factors and consequences of injury by comparing provider-specific anthropometric and objective procedural data to self-reported injury patterns. Methods A validated MSK symptom survey was sent to gastroenterologists to gauge prevalence, distribution, and severity of active injury. Respondents’ procedural activities over 7 years were collected via an endoscopic database. Results 64 surveys were completed. 54 respondents had active pain; 53.1% reported activity-limiting injury. Activity-limiting injuries lead to longer colonoscopy times (25.3 vs. 22.1 min, P = 0.03) and lower procedural volumes (532 vs. 807, P = 0.01). Hand/wrist injuries yielded longer colonoscopy insertion times (9.35 vs. 8.21 min, P = 0.03) and less hands-on scope hours (81.2 vs. 111.7 h, P = 0.04). Higher esophagogastroduodenoscopy volume corelated with shoulder injury (336.5 vs. 243.1 EGDs/year, P = 0.04). Females had more foot injuries (P = 0.04). Conclusion Activity-limiting MSK symptoms/injuries affect over 50% of endoscopists with negative impact on procedural volume and efficiency.",

Here, a novel textile-fabricated insole material with a 3D structure that offers good porosity and breathability for improving the footwear microclimate is proposed. Changes in foot skin temperature and humidity when wearing the textile-fabricated insole throughout treadmill walking are collected from 21 female subjects (age: 25.5 ± 4.5) and compared with traditional and 3D printed insoles. Subjective assessment of their perceived thermal comfort with various insole conditions is also conducted. In comparison to polyurethane, 3D printed thermoplastic polyurethane and leather insoles, textile-fabricated insoles show no significant changes in foot skin temperature. Nevertheless, a significant reduction of the relative humidity of the skin of the sole (3.21%) and heel (24.41%) is found.

    "doi": "10.1016/j.apergo.2022.103795",
    "abstract": "Human reliability analysis plays an important role in the safety assessment and management of rail operations. This paper discusses how the increasing availability of operational data can be used to develop an understanding of train driver reliability. The paper derives human reliability data for two driving tasks, stopping at red signals and controlling speed on approach to buffer stops. In the first of these cases, a tool has been developed that can estimate the number of times a signal is approached at red by trains on the Great Britain (GB) rail network. The tool has been developed using big data techniques and ideas, recording and analysing millions of pieces of data from live operational feeds to update and summarise statistics from thousands of signal locations in GB on a daily basis. The resulting driver reliability data are compared to similar analyses of other train driving tasks. This shows human reliability approaching the currently accepted limits of human performance. It also shows higher error rates amongst freight train drivers than passenger train drivers for these tasks. The paper highlights the importance of understanding the task specific performance limits if further improvements in human reliability are sought. It also provides a practical example of how big data could play an increasingly important role in system error management, whether from the perspective of understanding normal performance and the limits of performance for specific tasks or as the basis for dynamic safety indicators which, if not leading, could at least become closer to real time.",

    "abstract": "Presented is a framework that uses pattern classification methods to incrementally morph whole-body movement patterns to investigate how personal (sex, military experience, and body mass) and load characteristics affect the survivability tradespace: performance, musculoskeletal health, and susceptibility to enemy action. Sixteen civilians and 12 soldiers performed eight military-based movement patterns under three body-borne loads: ∼5.5 kg, ∼22 kg, and ∼38 kg. Our framework reduces dimensionality using principal component analysis and uses linear discriminant analysis to classify groups and morph movement patterns. Our framework produces morphed whole-body movement patterns that emulate previously published changes to the survivability tradespace caused by body-borne loads. Additionally, we identified that personal characteristics can greatly impact the tradespace when carrying heavy body-borne loads. Using our framework, military leaders can make decisions based on objective information for armour procurement, employment of armour, and battlefield performance, which can positively impact operational readiness and increase overall mission success.",

    "abstract": "The goal of this study was to quantify and compare prospective self-reported intraoperative workload and teamwork during robot-assisted radical prostatectomy (RARP) for multi-port da Vinci Xi (MP) and single-port da Vinci SP (SP) robots. The self-reported workload (surgeon and surgical team) and teamwork (surgeon) measures were collected and compared between MP and SP RARPs, as well as the learning curve. Results from 25 MP and SP RARPs showed that overall, the NASA-TLX workload subscales were lower, and the teamwork modified NOTECHS subscales were higher for the MP RARPs compared to the SP RARPs. The underlying reason for the significant differences between these two RARP surgical procedures could be other factors (e.g., robot design factors) in addition to the surgeon and surgical team's experience. The results also suggested learning effects through the 25 SP RARPs; however, twenty-five procedures may not be enough to achieve proficiency with the SP system.",

    "abstract": "Ladder falls from overreaching are a problem in older adults. Evidence suggests ladder use behavior to be dependent on interfacing user and environmental circumstances (i.e. situational factors). This study investigates the effects of situational factors (remaining debris, ladder position, time into task, hand dominant reach, reaching disposition) on reaching during a gutter clearing task on a ladder in 104 older adults. Reaching was quantified as the maximum lateral center of pressure (COP) displacement from the ladder's center. A reach was classified as an overreach when the COP displaced outside the ladder width, indicative of a ladder tip. Reaching disposition, remaining debris, ladder position, and the interaction of reaching disposition and remaining debris predicted 20% of the reaching variability during the ladder task. Overreaching was observed in 40% of participants accounting for 13% of all extended reaches (beyond ladder). This work can guide interventions on mitigating overreaching and improving ladder safety.",

    "abstract": "Despite the lack of haptic feedback, two-finger typing remains as a common freehand mid-air text entry method in VR. To compensate for this limitation, we investigated the effect of pseudo-haptics and thumb-to-finger pinch self-haptics. Three types of virtual keyboards were developed for comparison: a normal virtual keyboard without any haptic features, a pseudo-haptic keyboard providing a haptic illusion by adding pseudo-haptic features to the normal virtual keyboard, and a pinch keyboard providing passive self-haptic feedback when the index finger touches the thumb to type bubble-shaped keys. A follow-up user study was conducted on the three keyboards to measure typing performance, perceived workload, and user experience. The results showed that the pseudo-haptic and pinch keyboards were comparable to the normal one in typing performance and workload, but beneficial in user experience and preference. The findings suggest that pseudo-haptics and self-haptics could achieve experiential benefits in VR text entry without obtrusive extra devices.",

    "doi": "10.1016/j.apergo.2022.103767",
    "abstract": "Inattentiveness of road users on approach to passive railway crossings represents a major threat to level crossing safety. An auxiliary strobe light system installed on trains in addition to existing headlights may help address this issue by providing an ergonomic way of attracting human attention to the level crossing and to the train. The objective of this paper was to investigate the ergonomics and safety potential of auxiliary strobe light systems. A system was implemented on a real railway vehicle and in the virtual environment of a driving simulator. Acceptance of the system, including its usefulness and perceived benefits and drawbacks, as well as its objective effectiveness, were evaluated using questionnaires, behavioural measures, and eye tracking. The safety potential of the system was evaluated with respect to fatal level crossing accidents. The auxiliary strobe lights were preferred over normal lights and were rated as useful, reducing driving speeds, increasing visual scanning at level crossings, and thus aiding detection of a train. The system has the potential to prevent 6–30% of level crossing accidents in Europe. The results suggest that it might be worthwhile to test auxiliary strobe lights in a larger scale real-world experiment. Especially on railway lines with a high number of passive level crossings, this system can be expected to increase safety by supporting timely detection by road users and preventing accidents caused by inattentiveness.",

    "year": "2022",
    "doi": "10.1016/j.apergo.2022.103800",
    "abstract": "Introduction Excessive physical shoulder musculoskeletal loading (muscle and joint contact forces), known to contribute to work-related shoulder disorders, can be reduced by a passive shoulder exoskeleton during quasi-static tasks. However, its effect on neighboring joints i.e. elbow, lower back, hip, and knee and its effect on joint contact forces have not been investigated. Furthermore, the effect of the exoskeleton's assistance versus movement adaptation when wearing the exoskeleton on musculoskeletal loading remains unexplored. Methods 3D motion capture and ground reaction forces were measured while 16 participants performed 5 simulated occupational tasks with and without the exoskeleton. A musculoskeletal modeling workflow was used to calculate musculoskeletal loading. Shoulder muscle fatigue was quantified using surface EMG. In addition, exoskeletons usability was quantified using the system usability scale. Results When wearing the passive shoulder exoskeleton, shoulder and elbow musculoskeletal loading decreased during the high lift and overhead wiring task, without increasing the musculoskeletal load at the back, hip and knee. In contrast, musculoskeletal loading in the shoulder, as well as in the knee increased while lifting a box from the ground to knee height and from elbow height to shoulder height. When wearing the exoskeleton, muscle activity of the Trapezius descendens, Deltoideus medius and Biceps brachii were reduced during the high lift. Conclusion The passive shoulder exoskeleton reduces musculoskeletal loading in the lower back, shoulder and elbow during simulated occupational tasks above shoulder height. In contrast, for tasks below shoulder height, the use of the exoskeleton needs to be critically reviewed to avoid increased musculoskeletal loading also in neighboring joints due to altered movement execution when wearing the exoskeleton.",

The boxes contained the different types of pictograms mentioned above. Calculated factorial analyses on reaction time data, among others, showed that the two newly designed pictogram types make search more efficient compared to existing types of pictograms (i.e., flatter reaction time x set size slopes). Furthermore, regardless of the type of pictogram, this set size effect became more pronounced with larger memory sizes. Overall, the newly designed pictograms need fewer attentional resources and therefore might help to increase patient adherence.",

A Delphi process was used to design the stages of the framework based on literature and expert consensus. The CHOISSE framework was applied to guide the implementation and evaluation of e-checklists on team culture for ten pilot teams across the US over a 24-week period. The pilot results revealed more engagement by surgeons than non-surgeons, and significant increases in surgeons’ perception of communication and engagement during surgery with a small sample. Mixed methods analysis of the data and lessons learned were used to identify iterative improvements to the CHOISSE framework and to inform future studies.",

    "abstract": "Reaction forces from nutrunner tools constitute a risk of developing MSDs. However, recommendations for sustainable reaction force levels are lacking. The aim of this study was to inform recommendations regarding reaction load exposures from right-angle nutrunners. Through a psychophysics approach, experienced assembly workers subjectively assessed reaction loads when using a nutrunner in six combinations of tool tightening strategy, work-pace and screw-joint stiffness. Electromyography, tool and joint parameters were measured. Regardless of tightening strategy, joint stiffness and work-pace combinations, no large differences in acceptable tightening torque, peak reaction force, and handle displacement were observed. However, acceptable jerk and impulse differed substantially between the TurboTight® (high-acceleration) and QuickStep® (conventional) tightening strategies. Although the TurboTight® strategy overall showed reduced peak muscular activities compared to the QuickStep®, the participant-rated acceptable torque levels were similar, plausibly due to TurboTights’ high jerk levels. Jerk and impulse are hypothesized to influence the perception of reaction loads.",

Sixteen mountain rescuers walked on a treadmill at 3.6 km/h for 5 min in each combination of three slopes (1%, 10%, 20%) and five backpack loads (0%, 10%, 20%, 30%, and 40% body weight). Relative heart rate (%HRmax), relative oxygen consumption (%VO2max), and rating of perceived exertion (RPE, Borg 1–10 scale) were compared across conditions using two-way ANOVA. Significant differences in %VO2max, %HRmax, and RPE across slopes and loads were found where burden increased directly with slope and load (main effect of slope, p < 0.001 for all; main effect of load, p < 0.001 for all). Additionally, significant slope by load interactions were found for all parameters, indicating an additive effect (p < 0.001 for all).

Selecting suitable interaction modes in different scenarios is important to achieve efficient interaction in virtual scenes. This study compared the movement time in an object positioning task by examining eye-gaze interaction and head-gaze interaction in various conditions. In turn, it identified the superior zones for each mode, respectively. Based on this information, we designed a combination mode – utilizing eye-gaze interaction at the acceleration phase and deceleration phase and head-gaze interaction at the correction phase – to achieve the optimal interaction mode, which has allowed us to obtain higher efficiency and subjective satisfaction. This study provides a comprehensive analysis of the characteristics of the eye-gaze and head-gaze interaction modes and provides valuable insights into selecting the appropriate interaction modes for virtual reality applications.",

The literature on DLCI prediction is summarized in terms of input features, feature extraction and prediction time windows, labeling methods, and machine learning algorithms. The results show that eye tracking data features along with other data sources can be useful inputs for the prediction of DLCI. Major challenges in this line of research include determining the optimal time window for feature extraction and developing and evaluating the appropriate machine learning algorithm.

    "abstract": "Background Home care medical devices are the fastest-growing segment of the medical device industry with associated safety and usability challenges. Human factor studies in the home environment present many difficulties resulting in limited knowledge of device use in this setting. This systematic review aims to identify usability challenges reported directly by end-users in the home environment. Methods A systematic review of the literature was conducted concentrating on studies involving end user reporting. Reported challenges were grouped into a) device-user, b) device use environment and c) device-user interface challenges. Results 3471 studies were screened and 202 underwent full-text review. Only twelve studies had direct involvement of end users. Multiple challenges were identified, with device-user interface problems being the most common. No effective, standardised method was found to collect patient/user feedback on usability challenges in the post-market stage, leading to a knowledge gap. Conclusions This study brought together multiple usability challenges reported by individual studies. Involvement of medical device end-users in usability studies is essential and their experiences must be effectively utilised in device design.",

    "abstract": "The installation of shoulders on rural roads to create more forgiving roads encourages drivers to cut corners on right-hand bends, but the underlying mechanisms are poorly understood. Since eye movements and steering control are closely coupled, this study investigated how the presence of a shoulder influences drivers' gaze strategies. To this end, eighteen drivers negotiated right-hand bends with and without a shoulder on a simulated rural road. In the presence of a shoulder, participants modified their visual sampling of the road by directing their gaze further inside the bend. At the same time, their lane position was deviated inward throughout the bend and the vehicle spent more time out of the lane. These results suggest that the shoulder influences the visual processes involved in trajectory planning. Recommendations are made to encourage drivers to keep their eyes and vehicle in the driving lane when a shoulder is present.",

The methods for the work activity analysis combined interviews, observations, events and operations chronicles as well as inclinometry. From the work activity analysis of the three main tasks (changing mouse cages, preparation of water bottles and unloading dirty material), difficulties such as awkward postures, heavy load handling, repetitiveness, high workload, supplementary tasks, interruptions and difficult social interactions emerged. The work activity analysis further allowed the identification of determinants of these difficulties. Some are related to the physical, organizational or social work environment, and others to the interdependence between these determinants. Such an improved understanding of ART work activity will lead to solutions best suited for MSDs prevention in this understudied setting.",

    "abstract": "Effects of psychosocial hazards on risk of musculoskeletal disorders (MSDs) are often very substantial, but workplace risk management practices focus largely on biomechanical hazards, as do the risk assessment methods used by ergonomists. Translation of research evidence into more effective workplace practices demands a more holistic risk management framework that encompasses both types of hazard. In this context, we evaluate the validity of different MSD risk assessment methods for different purposes, focusing particularly on requirements for routine workplace risk management. These include choice of fit-for-purpose assessment methods, prioritisation of hazards that are most affecting risk, and control actions as high as possible in the risk control hierarchy. Ergonomists could facilitate more effective workplace risk management by promoting: awareness of the need for change; improvements to guidance from OHS regulators; research on MSD-related workplace management issues; and professional development programs on this topic for ergonomists and other OHS practitioners.",

    "doi": "10.1016/j.apergo.2022.103771",
    "abstract": "The current study analyzed the root causes of 22 helicopter accidents/incidents that took place between 1998 and 2019. Each root cause was coded using three commonly used classification models in aviation HFACS, ATSB, and IATA to identify recurring factors for better targeting of future prevention strategies. The frequency analysis revealed that not following procedure (22 observations), training inadequate or unavailable (17), inadequate regulatory oversight (17), inadequate procedure guidance (16), company management absent or deficient (10) and incorrect manuals/charts/checklists (9) were the most frequent contributing factors. Since none of the existing models could summarize the root causes of 22 occurrences effectively, a scenario-based human-machine-environment-procedure (HMEP) classification scheme was proposed to use organizational influences, people management, technical failure, procedure and document, and environment as the first-layer subcategories. The HMEP scheme was additionally applied to the analysis and coding of 4 helicopter accidents in the USA published by the NTSB. The HMEP scheme revealed that NTSB had identified a significantly greater number of root causes in the manufacturer design, manufacturing & documentation. Overall, HMEP can be used to guide the data collection during accident investigation and subsequently to aggregate aviation accidents to derive recurring factors and compare accident patterns in an efficient manner.",

Two types of palettes were developed for each experiment: monochrome and multi-hue. The three sets of monochrome palettes created were red, green, and blue, while four equidistant hues in the color wheel were used in the multi-hue palette: red, blue, green, and purple. A total of forty people participated in the two experiments. Participants performed two tasks for both experiments: maximum and discrimination tasks. The monochrome experiment showed the primacy of green in terms of RT and accuracy in the discrimination task. RT and accuracy were significantly affected by lightness in the multi-hue experiment. For both tasks, RT was longer for 20% lightness and lowest at 60% lightness. Accuracy results were also consistent with RT. In the discrimination task, participants made more errors in 20% lightness and the highest accuracy for 60% and 80%.",

    "abstract": "Objective This study aims to investigate the benefits of unimodal tactile displays relative to other modal displays and the performance gains of adding redundant tactile displays by integrating empirical studies. Background Tactile displays have attracted increasing attention in recent years due to their unique advantages. Synthesizing experimental data is necessary to analyze the performance benefits of tactile displays for participants and better help practitioners in utilizing them. Method Five meta-analyses were conducted. Two meta-analyses compared the participants’ performance between tactile and other modal displays (visual vs. tactile and auditory vs. tactile). Three meta-analyses examined the performance gains of adding redundant tactile displays based on other modal displays (visual vs. visual + tactile, auditory vs. auditory + tactile, and visual + auditory vs. visual + auditory + tactile). The related moderator variables, the types of presented information and concurrent tasks, were analyzed. Results Little evidence shows the performance difference between tactile and auditory displays. Tactile displays are more beneficial than visual displays for presenting alert information or in the situation with a visual concurrent task. The performance gains of adding redundant tactile displays to other modal displays also depend on the specific type of presented information and the concurrent task. Conclusion When using tactile displays to convey information, interface designers should consider the specific type of presented information and the concurrent tasks. Applications The present study's findings can provide some implications for designers to utilize tactile displays when they construct and implement information displays.",

We proposed a study directly carried out in industrial settings, to compare the impact of AR-based instructions to computerized instructions, on assembly effectiveness (completion time and errors) and mental workload using objective (eye tracking), subjective (NASA-TLX) and behavioral measurements (dual task paradigm). According to our results, AR did not improve effectiveness (increased assembly times and no decrease in assembly errors). Two out of three measurements indicated that AR led to more mental workload for simple assembly workstation, but equated computer instructions for complex workstation. Our data also suggest that, AR users were less able to detect external events (danger, alert), which may play an important role in the occurrence of work accidents.",

    "abstract": "Sensorimotor performance is known to deteriorate during spaceflight. Prior research for instance documented that targeted arm motions are performed slower and less precise in microgravity conditions. This article describes an experiment on aiming performance during different stages of a space mission. Moreover, the influence of different haptic settings of the human-machine interface (HMI) was explored. Two separate studies are presented in which the same aiming tasks were performed with a force feedback joystick: 1) A terrestrial study (N = 20) to explore time and haptic setting effects and 2) a space experiment (N = 3) with a pre-mission session, three mission sessions on board the ISS (2, 4, and 6 weeks in space), and a post-mission session. Results showed that sensorimotor performance was mainly affected in the initial phase of exposure to microgravity and this effect was moderated by astronauts’ sensorimotor skills. Providing low stiffness at the HMI, however, proved to be an effective measure to maintain aiming precision in microgravity.",

    "abstract": "Wearable robotic systems, such as exoskeletons, are designed to assist human motion; however, they are typically only studied during level walking. Before exoskeletons are broadly integrated into unstructured environments, it will be important to evaluate exoskeletons in a broader set of relevant tasks. A balance beam traverse was used to represent a constrained foot placement task for examining balance and stability. Participants (n = 17) completed the task in their own shoes (Pre-Exoskeleton and Post-Exoskeleton trials), and when wearing a lower-limb exoskeleton (Dephy ExoBoot) in both powered and unpowered states. Data were collected via inertial measurement units (on the torso and feet) and analyzed on a pooled level (with data from all participants) and on an individual level (participant-specific confidence intervals). When examining pooled data, it was observed that the exoskeleton had mixed effects on stride stability metrics. When compared to the Post-Exoskeleton shoe control, it was observed that stride duration was increased when wearing the exoskeleton (both powered and unpowered states), while normalized stride length and stride speed were not affected. Despite the changes in stride stability, overall balance (as measured by torso sway) remained unaffected by exoskeleton state. On an individual level, it was observed that not all participants followed these general trends, and within each metric, some increased, some decreased, and some had no change in the Powered Exoskeleton condition when compared to the Post-Exoskeleton Shoe condition: normalized stride length (0% increased, 12% decreased, 88% no change), stride duration (35% increased, 0% decreased, 65% no change), and torso sway (0% increased, 12% decreased, 88% no change). Our findings suggest that the lower-limb exoskeleton evaluated can be used during tasks that require balancing, and we recommend that balancing tasks be included in standards for exoskeleton evaluation.",

Auditory icons can be understood quickly, evoking a better user experience. However, as collision warnings, the design and application of auditory icons still need further exploration. Thus, this study aims to investigate the effects of internal semantic mapping and external acoustic characteristics (compression and dynamics design) on driver performance and subjective experience. Thirty-two participants (17 females) experienced 15 types of warnings — (3 dynamics: mapping 0 vs. 1 vs. 2) × (5 warning types: original iconic vs. original metaphorical vs. compressed iconic vs. compressed metaphorical auditory icon vs. earcon) — in a simulator. We found that compression design was effective for rapid risk avoidance, which was more effective in iconic and highly pitch-dynamic sounds. This study provides additional ideas and principles for the design of auditory icon warnings.",

    "year": "2022",
    "doi": "10.1016/j.apergo.2022.103796",
    "abstract": "Background Most adults prefer to age in place. However, the majority of homes are not designed to support resident needs, especially for adults undergoing joint replacement surgeries such as total knee arthroplasty (TKA) or total hip arthroplasty (THA). It is of paramount importance to proactively assess and modify the homes of adults undergoing TKA/THA such that they can safely transition home following surgery. Several tools utilize emerging technology like virtual reality, augmented reality, or teleconferencing to assess home environments. These are meant to be used by professionals like occupational therapists. However, the acceptance and uptake of simple technology like mobile applications for assessing homes proactively by residents has not been explored. Objective A qualitative exploratory study was conducted to evaluate the feasibility and potential acceptance of a mobile application for resident-initiated home assessment. Methods Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 22 patient-care partner dyads before and after THA/TKA to understand the perceived usefulness, likelihood of using a mobile application-based home assessment tool, and perceived barriers and facilitators of using the tool. Results About 68% of the patient-care partner dyads interviewed for this study perceived benefits of using a mobile application-based tool. All the participants who perceived the tool to be useful showed high likelihood of using it. A comparison of responses between pre-and post-surgery interviews revealed that around 50% of participants showed an increased intention of using an assessment tool after experiencing challenges in their homes post-surgery. Participants provided recommendations for key content, potential features to include in the assessment tool, and preferred formats (e.g., checklists, visuals, and videos). Conclusions To increase acceptance of a mobile application-based home assessment tool, it is crucial that residents are made aware of the home environment challenges and the importance of an assessment tool to improve their safety and independence. The content, features, formats, and usability suggestions from the participants in this study provide a framework for health mobile application and interface developers to design a home assessment tool.",

    "doi": "10.1016/j.apergo.2022.103773",
    "abstract": "Objective The primary objective of the study was to evaluate the effect of a secondary motor task induced by an interactive seating system (IASS) on passive driver fatigue in a monotonous simulated driving task. The effect was compared to that of a state-of-the-art massage seating system (MS), which may reduce monotony through additional tactile stimuli. The secondary objective was to compare the user experience of both systems. Method The independent variables were three conditions: one with the IASS, another with the MS, and a control without intervention. The study included seven dependent variables in total: a rating of subjective fatigue, three parameters measuring lane keeping ability, and three parameters reflecting fatigue-related eye movements. The duration of the simulator ride was 40 min in each condition. The study included thirty-five subjects. Results The assessment of subjective fatigue and lane keeping showed that the use of the IASS resulted in significantly lower passive driver fatigue compared to the massage and control conditions. The alerting effects of the IASS were also reflected by an increased eyelid distance. Frequency and duration of blinks, however, showed no clear patterns of fatigue over time in any of the conditions. Thus, both parameters did not seem be suitable to capture passive driver fatigue in this study. Regarding user experience, the subjects preferred the IASS over the MS as well. Conclusion The IASS showed a strong potential as an effective measure against passive driver fatigue within monotonous driving situations. The MS, on the other hand, induced no measurable effects.",

    "abstract": "This study examined associations between metrics of noise exposure and mental workload. In this cross-sectional study, five occupational noise metrics computed from full-shift dosimetry were evaluated among surface mine workers in the US Midwest. Mental workload was evaluated using a modified, raw NASA-TLX and clustered with a k-means clustering algorithm. Mixed effects logistic regression and Bayesian Kernel Machine Regression (BKMR) was utilized for analysis. Average noise exposure, the difference between peak and mean noise exposure, and the number of peaks >135 dB were each strongly associated with mental workload, while the kurtosis and standard deviation of noise throughout a shift were not. An exposure-response relationship between average noise exposure and mental workload may exist, with elevated risk of high mental workload beginning at 80 dBA. These results suggest that high noise exposure may be an independent risk factor of high mental workload, and impulse events and the difference between the peak and mean noise exposure may have interactive effects with average noise exposure.",

    "doi": "10.1016/j.apergo.2022.103762",
    "abstract": "With the introduction of Level 3 and 4 automated driving, the engagement in a variety of non-driving related activities (NDRAs) will become legal. Previous research has shown that users desire information about the remaining time in automated driving mode and system status information to plan and terminate their activity engagement. In past studies, however, the positive effect of this additional information was realized when it was integrated in or displayed close by the NDRA. As future activities and corresponding items will be diverse, a device-independent and non-interruptive way of communication is required to continuously keep the user informed, thus avoiding negative effects on driver comfort and safety. With a set of two driving simulator studies, we have investigated the effectiveness of ambient light display (ALD) concepts communicating remaining time and system status when engaged in visually distracting NDRAs. In the first study with 21 participants, a traffic light color-coded ALD concept (LED stripe positioned at the bottom of the windshield) was compared to a baseline concept in two subsequent drives. Subjects were asked to rate usability, workload, trust, and their use of travel time after each drive. Furthermore, gaze data and NDRA disengagement timing was analyzed. The ALD with three discrete time steps led to improved usability ratings and lower workload levels compared to the baseline interface without any ALD. No significant effects on trust, attention ratio, travel time evaluation, and NDRA continuation were found, but a vast majority favored the ALD. Due to this positive evaluation, the traffic light ALD concept was subsequently improved and compared to an elapsing concept in a subsequent study with 32 participants. In addition to the first study, the focus was on the intuitiveness of the developed concepts. In a similar setting, results revealed no significant differences between the ALD concepts in subjective ratings (workload, usability, trust, travel time ratings), but advantages of the traffic light concept can be found in terms of its intuitiveness and the level of support experienced.",

    "abstract": "Cybersickness refers to the uncomfortable side effects, such as headaches, dizziness, and nausea, felt while experiencing virtual reality (VR). This study investigated cybersickness in people with sensitivity to motion sickness using electroencephalography (EEG), the Simulator Sickness Questionnaire (SSQ), and simple VR content. Based on the scores from the Motion Sickness Susceptibility Questionnaire (MSSQ), 40 males in their twenties were selected as the sensitive group (n = 20) and non-sensitive group (n = 20). The experiment contained two conditions: a baseline condition representing a resting state and a cybersickness condition in which watching VR content induced cybersickness. The SSQ score increased significantly after watching the VR content in both groups. The sensitive group showed significantly lower absolute power in the beta and gamma bands than the non-sensitive group. The cybersickness condition showed significantly increased delta and decreased alpha compared to the baseline condition. We evaluated EEG and SSQ to identify subjective symptoms and objective physiological changes associated with cybersickness.",

    "abstract": "Objective To test six different methods of directing a user's attention in a peripheral head mounted display assisted visual search task. Background Each time a user needs to shift their attention between virtual information and their environment has a cost. The faster a user can process a guiding cue and the fewer times they need to return to it, the more efficient that cue will be at directing a user's attention. The most effective method, creating a visual effect at the location of the target, is not suitable for peripheral head mounted displays. This study tests alternative guiding cues better suited to these devices. Method Participants searched for a singleton target hidden among 299 distractors while directed with one of six device-delivered guiding cues. Search times were recorded. Results A static region map was the most efficient and most preferred cue. Static and dynamic directional cues were also effective in comparison to non-guided search. Cues designed to work solely within the participants’ peripheral vision were relatively ineffective Conclusion Guidance cues that direct a user's attention to targets within the real environment do not need to precisely lead to the target. It is instead more efficient to lead a user to the general vicinity of the target quickly and then have the user revert to their natural visual search behaviour. Application This finding is broadly useful when assisting visual search tasks with handheld or worn devices which do not cover the user's full field of view. Précis This study tested six different methods of guiding attention in a peripheral head-mounted display assisted visual search task. This study compared static, dynamic and peripheral-vision endogenous cues to targets and found a static simple map cue both fastest and most preferred by users.",

    "abstract": "Technological advancements have increased occupational flexibility for employees and employers alike. However, while effective telework requires planning, the COVID-19 pandemic required many employees to quickly shift to working from home without ensuring that the requirements for telework were in place. This study evaluated the transition to telework on university faculty and staff and investigated the effect of one's telework setup and ergonomics training on work-related discomfort in the at-home environment. Fifty-one percent of respondents reported increases in their existing discomfort while 24% reported new discomfort since working from home. These results suggest a need for ergonomic interventions including ergonomic training and individual ergonomic assessments for those who work from home.",

    "abstract": "The relationship between sleep and health and wellbeing is receiving increasing attention in our society, following decades of research that has demonstrated the impact of insufficient sleep on performance and health. Fatigue has been identified as a factor in 21% of high-risk incidents in the GB rail industry, and insufficient sleep and long periods of being awake are known to be two key contributors to fatigue. This paper presents evidence from a recent survey conducted in the GB rail industry, which enabled the sleep and wakefulness of railway workers to be quantified. There were 7807 responses to the survey, which represents a very large sample. Responses were primarily collected online, though paper copies were made available in some organisations. Respondents reported sleeping less when working nights, more when working days, and the most on days off, which suggests a feast-and-famine pattern of sleep. 41% were getting 6 h of sleep or less when working days, compared to 63% when working nights. Getting 6 h or less of sleep was associated with excessive daytime sleepiness. Although it is accepted that individuals’ sleep requirements vary, the patterns that shift workers reported in this survey suggest that many are not achieving the amount of sleep they need. The findings of the survey presented in this paper highlight that there is work to be done to understand and address the causes of insufficient sleep in railway workers.",

    "abstract": "In this three-year study we examined the effect on work ability in a cohort of workers before and after the implementation of a workplace intervention based on the APHIRM (A Participative Hazard Identification and Risk Management) toolkit. Primary analysis was conducted to detect changes in mean work ability scores between baseline and three-year follow-up for all workers who completed the surveys (matched and unmatched), and all workers who were ≥50 years of age (matched and unmatched). There were no significant differences between the two time periods. A secondary analysis was undertaken to examine associations between risk factors and work ability scores. This identified that six of the 18 psychosocial risk factors, and three of the eight physical risk factors associated with reduced work ability at baseline were no longer significant. These results indicate that the APHIRM toolkit may be effective in identifying hazards which, if addressed, could contribute to the maintenance of work ability over time.",

    "doi": "10.1016/j.apergo.2022.103750",
    "abstract": "This paper presents a comparison of four common Human Reliability Assessment (HRA) models through a scoping literature review and sensitivity analysis. The scoping literature review identified 72 relevant studies which formed the basis of the comparison. Studies reported the four selected models have similarities in terms of the sector of origin, applied sectors, output calculation, and a lack of clear guidelines on Performance Influencing Factors (PIFs) selection and risk level allocation. The studied models have differences in the number and type of PIF inputs and Human Error Probability (HEP) calculation procedures. The One Factor At a Time (OFAT) and “combined” sensitivity analysis were conducted to examine the HRA models’ responses to systematic risk level changes when each of 8 matching PIFs were systematically set to “high” and then “low” levels individually and simultaneously. The OFAT analysis showed coefficients of variation (CV) in HEP varying from 9% for skills/training up to 94% for work procedure when the PIFs are assigned to a “low” risk level individually. The combined analysis showed the median HEP value close to 97% and 1% when PIFs are assigned to” high” and “low” risk levels respectively. Although the selected HRA models were reported to be validated in high-risk domains there was no study found that validated these models in low-risk domains such as manual order picking, or manual assembly lines. The HRA models examined here are disconnected from specific system design elements which can inhibit design improvement efforts. The study outcome suggests the need for clear guidelines for PIFs selection and risk level allocation. Future research should address both the connection of error assessment to the design of the system and the features of new HRA models that affect its reliability and validity in a variety of industrial contexts.",

    "abstract": "This driving simulator study aimed to encourage cooperative lane changes through vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communication and explore whether emotional or rational communication content is better in promoting cooperative lane change. A total of 960 lane-changing datapoints from 30 participants in a driving simulation environment were collected. The participants’ behavior, driving-related data, and emotional responses were recorded and analyzed. The results revealed that the trigger time to collision (TTC) between the lane changer and the following vehicle in the target lane and communication types were all important factors influencing the willingness of drivers to cooperate. V2V communication could significantly increase the willingness of the driver in the following vehicle to cooperate compared to the traditional method in which desire to change lanes is conveyed with only turn lights. The effect of different communication contents on willingness to cooperate did not vary significantly; however, emotional communication was superior to rational communication in some cases. This indicates that changing lanes owing to an emergency was more likely to be successful. The results of this study can provide a reference for V2V communication design for a safer and more comfortable driving experience.",

    "doi": "10.1016/j.apergo.2022.103746",
    "abstract": "In augmented reality (AR), virtual information is optically combined with the physical environment. In the most frequently used combination technique, optical settings in AR depart from the settings in natural viewing. Depending on the combination of viewing distances of the virtual task and its physical background, this deviation may lower visual performance and cause visual disturbance symptoms. The so-called vergence-accommodation conflict (VAC) has been identified as a cause for the visual disturbance symptoms in AR. In this study, for various distance combinations, the performance and symptoms when performing a search task displayed in a see-through head-mounted display (AR HMD, HoloLens 1st generation, Microsoft, USA) was investigated. The search task was displayed at a virtual distance of either 200 cm or 30 cm, and the real background was viewed either at a distance of 200 cm or 30 cm. Three combinations of viewing distances for the background and the virtual task were studied: 200 cm/200 cm, 200 cm/30 cm, and 30 cm/30 cm. Results revealed that both performance and visual disturbance symptoms depend on the combination of the viewing distances of the physical background and the virtual task. When the physical background was viewed at a distance of 200 cm, younger participants showed a significantly better search performance and reported stronger symptoms compared with older participants, no matter whether the virtual task was performed at 30 cm or at 200 cm. However, with the physical background at a distance of 30 cm, the performance of the younger group dropped to the level of the performance of the older group, and younger participants tended to report a stronger increase in visual disturbance symptoms compared with the older participants. From the AR HMD technology used in this study, it can be concluded that a near viewing distance of the virtual task does not cause a negative impact on performance and visual disturbance symptoms, provided any physical background seen through the AR HMD is not at a near viewing distance. The findings indicate that the VAC, which persists in augmented and virtual reality, depends, in addition to the physical component evaluating the optical distance, on a cognitive component evaluating the perceived distance. AR settings should therefore also be evaluated in terms of possible effects on perceived distance.",

Thus, improving the level of network security and preventing phishing are a matter of great concern to both the state and researchers. A 2 (automation trust tendency) *2 (system reliability level) *2 (feedback) between-subjects design was adopted to study the impact of individual characteristics and system features on phishing detection. Three hundred ninety-eight participants completed a phishing email task to identify whether 40 emails were legitimate or fraudulent. The results showed that systems with feedback and high reliability improve users’ performance in email identification. Users with a high tendency towards automation trust have a higher risk of phishing. However, feedback from the system helps calibrate a high automation trust tendency. These research results can promote an understanding of phishing prevention mechanisms and provide support for the design of email defence systems.",

The fictional IRs using tips were more accurate, with increased descriptions of the patient's background, reporter's actions, team members' actions and conversations, safety check procedures, result of the error, and post-incident response. The reporter's actions, work procedures, and environment were more clarified in the trainees' IRs than in the non-trainees’ IRs.

    "abstract": "The present study sought to manipulate workload individually for participants to evaluate whether individual manipulations of workload produces similar subjective ratings and performance changes across participants. Participants included eight Army-rated rotary-wing aviators who presented to the laboratory for two separate visits. During the first visit, individual responses to workload were determined, and during the second visit, individually manipulated high workload flights were completed. Outcome measures included flight performance and subjective workload ratings. Data were examined at the group and individual level. Subjective ratings of workload endorsed the individual workload manipulations, while performance data provided some additional support. By taking an individualized approach such as this, researchers and practitioners may be better able to control for individual differences influencing workload. This has important implications for system design and testing, development of new intervention technologies, and assessing methods for operator monitoring.",

    "abstract": "Existing ergonomic risk assessment tools require monitoring of multiple risk factors. To eliminate the direct observation, we investigated the effectiveness of an end-to-end framework that works with the data from a single wearable sensor. The framework is used to identify the performed task as the major contextual risk factor, and then estimate the task duration and number of repetitions as two main indicators of task intensity. For evaluation of the framework, we recruited 37 participants to complete 10 simulated work tasks in a laboratory setting. In testing, we achieved an average accuracy of 92% for task identification, 7.3% error in estimation of task duration, and 7.1% error for counting the number of task repetitions. Moreover, we showed the utility of the framework outputs in two ergonomic tools to estimate the risk of injury. Overall, we indicated the feasibility of using data from wearable sensors to automate the ergonomic risk assessment in workplaces.",

    "abstract": "Work-related musculoskeletal disorders have been recognized as a global problem that affects millions of people annually. Fatigue is one of the main contributors to musculoskeletal disorders. Thus, this study investigated fatigue detection based on the measured body motion by wearable inertial measurement units. We quantified the body motion during manual handling tasks using a novel kinematic score (i.e., K-score), and the Rapid Entire Body Assessment (REBA). K-score and REBA were calculated using joint angles. Nevertheless, unlike REBA, K-score showed a significant correlation (Spearman's correlation coefficient of ρ(302) = 0.21, p < 0.05) with electromyography (EMG) signal amplitude, which was affected by muscle fatigue. Therefore, in-field measurement of K-score using inertial measurement units could detect the fatigue-induced change of body motion in long-duration manual handling tasks. Our proposed K-score can be used to assess fatigue-related ergonomic risk in long-term and real-world working conditions without the need for tedious EMG recording at workplaces.",

    "doi": "10.1016/j.apergo.2022.103723",
    "abstract": "Sedentary behavior has increased steadily over prior decades, primarily due to increased computer use at work and at home. The total sedentary time per day has been associated with increased risk of cardiometabolic diseases; increased sitting time at work has been associated with musculoskeletal discomfort particularly in the low back. Office workers spend many hours sitting, thus efforts to increase movement through changes of posture (sit to stand) or moving while sitting have been proposed as ways to mitigate the negative effects of prolonged sitting. Yet, few studies have investigated differences in the movement patterns of office workers while sitting performing their actual work. Therefore, the aim of this study was to characterize movement patterns during a prolonged sitting bout and to determine their association with musculoskeletal pain. Twenty-eight office workers participated in this field study that used a pressure sensitive mat to quantify seat pan pressure (4 regions) and trunk sway parameters over a 2-hour bout of computer work. Data were stratified by breakers who stood up at least once within the 2-hour test and prolongers who remained sitting throughout the test. Overall, there was a decreasing trend in trunk sway parameters (mean COP position, sway path, sway area, sway velocity, maximum displacement, and in-chair movements) over time (p < 0.05), with significant changes in sitting strategies. There were significant differences in trunk sway parameters and perceived musculoskeletal discomfort between breakers and prolongers with breakers having more consistent movement while sitting over the prolonged sitting bout (p < 0.05) and lower discomfort ratings. This may indicate that interrupting prolonged bouts of sitting with short periods of standing can maintain sitting movement patterns and reduce the development of musculoskeletal discomfort. Trunk sway monitoring and promoting periodic standing may be useful tools for maintaining in chair movements that may reduce or prevent the onset of musculoskeletal discomfort during prolonged sitting.",

    "abstract": "The control of rail signalling is known to be highly dependent on local knowledge and local factors. It is also known to be highly cognitive in its nature involving a constant balancing of system performance within the constraints of safety. In the current paper, data generated through field work with signallers were used to understand the role of local knowledge, set against the background of an existing Local Knowledge Framework (Pickup et al., 2013) that was proposed to help determine the contents and mechanisms behind local knowledge in rail signalling. The field work included interviews with signallers and operations managers along with observations of signaller work. The results showed that the local knowledge framework needs to be expanded to include aspects related to the general public at user worked crossings and level crossings. In addition, the analysis highlights some of the issues with the transmission of local knowledge. The paper then discusses some of the gaps in the current framework, highlighting the importance not only of local knowledge for specific functions of signalling, but how these interact to support trade-offs to balance performance with safety. The implications for the design of signaller work are discussed.",

    "abstract": "Objective We examined the impact of performing a cognitive task of varying loads and kayaking simultaneously, compared to performance on the same tasks individually. Background When two tasks are performed together, performance often suffers compared to performance on either task alone. Interference not only occurs in competing cognitive tasks, but has also been found with certain physically demanding activities, such as climbing. Method Skilled kayakers performed a kayak course on open water, performed a high and a low cognitive load tone counting task, and also performed the kayak and counting tasks simultaneously. Results Despite some past research finding dual task facilitation with laboratory aerobic activities, simultaneous kayaking and tone counting led to dual-task interference. Conclusion Concurrent counting and kayaking led to performance impairments in both tasks, relative to single task performance. Application The present results are applicable to occupations involving concurrent demanding physical activity and cognitive task performance, such as the work of first responders and military operators. Précis Kayaking, like climbing, appears to hinder cognitive performance more than the low-risk physical tasks carried out in laboratory conditions.",

Therefore, we examined self-reported stress (Stockholm University Stress Scale) of shift-working tram and long-haul truck drivers (n = 75) across 2–3 weeks. Furthermore, stressors were self-reported retrospectively and categorised as related to the job, driving conditions, personal, or other causes. Stress levels were generally low, but moderate to high stress (≥6) was more frequently reported among the tram drivers. Stressors related to the job (54%) and driving conditions (19% of all shifts) were frequently reported among the tram and truck drivers, respectively. Moderate to high stress was associated with categorised stressors related to the job and other causes among the tram drivers, and all categorised stressors among the truck drivers. Altogether, self-reported stress and stressors differ by driver group, but the role of shift type is less significant.",

    "doi": "10.1016/j.apergo.2022.103748",
    "abstract": "The purpose of this study was to work systematically through all known measures for preventing railway suicides and to consider their suitability for the Finnish railway environment. The research method included a selection and grouping of measures, definition of assessment criteria, a literature review and compilation of assessment forms, and a workshop for experts in the field. We assessed 21 measures based on 12 specified criteria. Specifically, the aim of these criteria was to support the identification and structuring of the available information on each measure to be in easily exploitable format for railway stakeholders. The measures were listed in order of priority in three categories based on final assessments from the workshop. The measures categorised as top priority with the highest potential to reduce suicides on Finnish railways included training of railway personnel to identify suicidal people (also called Gatekeeper training), camera surveillance, detection systems (radar, movement sensors, etc.), collaboration between organisations, learning from international experience, cooperation between railway organisations, police and fire and rescue services, and training of mental health providers. This prioritisation, together with the information included in the assessment forms and expert's views related to each measure, support the Finnish railway stakeholders in selecting measures and defining implementation strategies to prevent railway suicides on Finnish railways. The insights of Finnish experts on the effectiveness and potential implementation of these different measures are valuable information also for railway stakeholders in other countries when selecting appropriate measures to prevent railway suicides. The results of this study support the safe and effective functioning of the railway system by adding knowledge that will help effectively prevent railway suicides and loss of life, delays to train traffic, and work-related stress and trauma to railway staff, rescue personnel and eyewitnesses.",

The purpose of this study was to describe nurses’ perceptions of the critical care work system during the COVID-19 pandemic in the U.S. We conducted interviews with experienced critical care nurses who worked during the pandemic and analyzed these data using deductive content analysis framed by the Systems Engineering Initiative for Patient Safety (SEIPS) 2.0 model. Concepts include the critical care work system structures, nursing care processes, outcomes, and adaptations during the pandemic. Our findings revealed a description of the critical care work system framed by the SEIPS 2.0 model.

    "abstract": "This study aimed to evaluate the effects of workstation adjustment to reduce postural exposure and perceived discomfort among office workers in a cluster randomized controlled trial. Experimental (EG, n = 31) and control groups (CG, n = 30) were compared before (pre-intervention), immediately (post-intervention), and 3 months after (follow up) the intervention. EG received workstation adjustments and CG did not received the intervention. Postural exposure of head, upper back and upper arms was objectively measured by inclinometers. Overall level of perceived discomfort for the whole body was evaluated using a visual analogue scale (0–100 mm). EG showed a statistically significant reduction on the head (pre: 10.1°, SD 5.7°; post: 6.6°, SD 4.7°) and upper back flexion (pre: 15.4°, SD 10.7°; post: 10.4°, SD 8.4°) from pre to post-intervention. EG also showed a statistically significant reduction from pre (50.7°, SD 9.5°) to post-intervention (42.1°, SD 7.6°) and from pre to follow up (41.6°, SD 6.5°) on upper arm elevation. CG did not show any difference between evaluations. Perceived discomfort increased 7.2 (SD 2.0) mm in CG and decreased 22.1 (SD 2.2) mm in EG between pre and post intervention. The variation between pre intervention and follow up was 4.5 (SD 1.2) mm increase for the CG and 24.1 (SD 1.5) mm of reduction for the EG (P < 0.01). There was no significant difference for the post intervention and follow up for both groups (P > 0.05). The results show evidence of the workstation adjustment to reduce postural exposure and perceived discomfort among office workers.",

A total of 791 respondents (21.0% response rate) participated in the survey. Certified ergonomics professionals represented an important subpopulation of MSD risk assessment tool users, however; the vast majority (86.4%) of users within Canada were certified safety professionals. Average tool use varied between ACE and BCRSP groups, where ACE respondents on average use more tools than BCRSP respondents, however the top 10 tools used were similar between the groups. Over 45% of assessment tools were learned at school and average tool use was not influenced by years of experience or continuing education.",

    "abstract": "To teach a skilled motor task, it is crucial to understand the characteristics of expertise. The aim of the present study was to compare the kinematics of the hand sewing task between novices (n = 10), intermediates (n = 10) and experts (n = 10). Compared to novices and intermediates, the proximal joint of expert participants was less involved in the task than their distal joints. The shoulder of experts stayed closer to the trunk, while the ranges of motion of the wrist and fingers were higher. This ability enabled them to avoid lifting the arm, which was resting on the table. We observed a low cycle-to-cycle variability of the movement pattern for experts, while it was more variable in novices. Moreover, experts shared similar joints synergies attesting of an “experts” common gesture. This knowledge gained about the hand sewing kinematics can be used to refine the training process of dressmakers.",

    "abstract": "The psychological refractory period (PRP) effect denotes the finding that shortening the temporal interval between two tasks leads to increased reaction time in the second task. Earlier work in driving simulators confirmed the emergence of a PRP effect even if the second task (T2) was ecologically relevant, such as in a car-braking task. Here we evaluate the PRP effect if the first task (T1) is ecologically relevant as well. In a driving simulator, participants had to warn pedestrians against crossing the street (T1), and had to brake when the lead car braked (T2). As the temporal interval between tasks decreased, reaction time in T2 increased, confirming once more the emergence of a PRP effect. The PRP effect in our study was larger than in previous studies where T1 was artificial rather than ecologically relevant. This suggests that an ecologically relevant T1 is processed more elaborately, resulting in stronger interference with T2.",

Previous reviews summarized the tools available for single-task exposure assessment, however no reviews summarize tools available to assess the accumulation or aggregation of exposure associated with the performance of multiple tasks (i.e., multi-task assessment). We address this gap by using a scoping review methodology to: 1) summarize the theories explaining how multi-task exposures may lead to MSDs, and 2) summarize the models and tools available to assess multi-task exposures, stratified based on prevailing theories. Using a systematic search strategy, 3230 articles were identified, of which 34 were retained for data extraction. Of the retained articles, 13 described MSD causation theories, 12 described mathematical models (not yet accessible as tools), six described readily accessible tools, and three described both theories and a model or tool. We summarized the state-of-the-art in multi-task exposure assessment and highlight the need for more tools that assess muscle fatigue and inform on recovery.",

    "abstract": "Wrist actigraph and self-report activity logs were used in a Royal Canadian Navy's at-sea exercise to track sleep patterns of naval personnel. In this study, we compared sleep parameters obtained from two measurement methods and investigated their intrinsic biases. The results revealed a strong agreement between two methods for recording sleep offset times, but a relatively poor agreement for parameters that include substantial periods of transition between sleep and wake states. Overall, self-reported sleep durations were substantially longer than actigraphic estimates (mean bias of −30.6 min; limits of agreement −95.9 to 34.8 min), and the discrepancy was mainly caused by differences in two methods to track sleep onset latency and Wake-up After Sleep Onset (WASO). Based on a customised activity log, a strong positive correlation (rho = 0.75, p < .001) between self-report and actigraphy was observed for sleep duration estimates, which confirmed the effectiveness of the activity log in field studies. Between two participant groups with different work schedules, the agreement between self-report and actigraphy was consistently better for day workers than watch keepers. The findings inform future sleep research planning that involves naval personnel in field settings.",

    "doi": "10.1016/j.apergo.2022.103745",
    "abstract": "The objective of this paper is to analyze the existing literature to determine the scope and risk factors of slips, trips, and falls (STFs) within the janitorial population in order to make evidence-based recommendations to prevent these incidents in the future. Selected for review were published peer-reviewed articles, conference proceedings, and gray literature relating to STFs among janitors and cleaners. Individuals employed as janitors and cleaners, specifically those that were older than 45-years of age and/or female, represented the highest risk populations for STFs. These STFs result in injuries, such as sprains, strains, dislocations, and tears. Among janitors and cleaners, 30% of nonfatal incidents are attributed to STFs, resulting in a median of 11 days away from work. Both non-observable/human factors and observable/organizational factors contribute to STFs within this population and must be addressed to protect public health. Preventive interventions focused on comprehensive approaches that target observable and non-observable factors are needed to reduce STFs within the custodial population. More research is needed on STFs in the janitorial population to identify successful preventive STF interventions. Addressing the issue of STFs within this job classification will improve the overall health and well-being of janitors as well as reduce the indirect and direct economic burden placed on the employer organization.",

    "abstract": "This cross-sectional study examined the physiological effects of two active chairs (AC1: had the feature to pedal and slide forward; AC2: was a multiaxial chair) compared to a traditional office chair and standing workstation. Twenty-four healthy participants computed at each of the workstations for 60 min. The active protocol was to alternate between a pedalling/side-to-side motion and sliding forward/front-to-back motion to the sound of a metronome operating at 40 bpm. The participants' physiological effects were recorded using near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS); electrodermal activity (EDA) and a heart rate (HR) monitor for each collection period. Statistical analysis was conducted using a repeated measures analysis of variance for within-task and between-workstation comparisons. A Tukey's post hoc analysis was calculated for significant findings. Both active chairs significantly increased oxygenated blood in the gastrocnemius and participants' heart rate and EDA (stress) levels were affected slightly by task and time. However, participants felt more “productive” sitting in the control chair than in either of the active chairs.",

This paper takes a two-pronged approach to uncover and model the complexity of industrial inspection in a manner that aligns with the technical development stages of a Cyber-Physical-Social System. The findings offer thick descriptions accompanied by four descriptive empirical models that depict inspectors' meaning-making and decision-making processes. It includes how they gather, process, and apply domain-specific knowledge to diagnose a component's condition and how they deal with domain-related factors (norms, institution's rules, standard operating procedures). This study also highlights the support provided by empirical data/models in designers' work packages. It concludes by presenting the design implications of these findings to envision future human-automation work situations.",

A mixed methods survey was used to examine usability of individual mask design components, the relationship of facial/head area to mask features, and overall mask design. Survey results indicated MNmask v1 demonstrated higher usability in seal confidence (M = 3.46), while MNmask v2 performed higher in satisfactory fit (M = 3.50). Design components of nose wire and head/neck bands were the most problematic, while conditions of skin irritation and tight/loose fit created an unfavorable wear experience.

    "abstract": "Chronic pain affects one in five Australians, and this could impact daily activities such as driving. Driving is a complex task, which requires the cognitive and physical ability to predict, identify, and respond to hazards to avoid crashing. However, research exploring the factors that influence safe driving behaviour for chronic pain individuals is limited. A qualitative study was conducted which involved semi-structured interviews with 23 people who had experienced persistent pain for at least three months and 17 health professionals who had experience working with individuals with chronic pain. The aim of this study was to obtain a deeper understanding of the experiences and challenges that people with chronic pain may have in their day-to-day driving. Participants were also asked about currently available driving assessments and strategies for individuals with chronic pain in the Australian healthcare system. The themes emerging from the interviews highlighted the need for clearer guidelines and educational materials regarding the impact of chronic pain on an individual's ability to drive. These themes included the physical and cognitive challenges resulting from chronic pain, as well as the potential side effects of pain medications. In addition, participants identified a number of self-regulation strategies and driving assessments currently available for monitoring safe driving behaviour in Australia. This study improves our understanding of how chronic pain affects driving behaviour, as reported by individuals experiencing the pain and relevant health professionals. Recommendations for improving the safety of drivers with chronic pain are discussed, including possible technological interventions and better public education.",

    "abstract": "Although the objective assessment of mental workload has been a focus of human factors research, few studies have investigated stakeholders' attitudes towards its implementation in real workplaces. The present study addresses this research gap by surveying N = 702 managers in three European countries (Germany, United Kingdom, Spain) about their expectations and concerns regarding sensor-based monitoring of employee mental workload. The data confirm the relevance of expectations regarding improvements of workplace design and employee well-being, as well as concerns about restrictions of employees' privacy and sovereignty, for the implementation of workload monitoring. Furthermore, Bayesian regression models show that the examined expectations have a substantial positive association with managers’ willingness to support workload monitoring in their company. Privacy concerns are identified as a significant barrier to the acceptance of workload monitoring, both in terms of their prevalence among managers and their strong negative relationship with monitoring support.",

    "abstract": "The scale and pace of improvement in patient safety in healthcare has been unacceptably slow. A paucity of research into the application of systems-thinking concepts and a failure to appreciate health systems complexity are cited as barriers to sustainable health systems improvement. This study reports on a socio-technical systems analysis, called the CUBE, of the characteristics of a large acute teaching hospital's system for the transport of precious specimens, a system enabled by radio-frequency identification tracking technology. The CUBE proved itself to be an effective analytic tool. The analysis provided a constructive framework to link diverse data and documentation; explicitly inviting consideration of the roles and understandings of different stakeholders; as well as broader cultural factors that could influence current or future activity. The analysis also supported recommendations to improve and extend operations. This study supports the argument for systems understanding and systems thinking being at the core of new approaches to patient safety.",

    "abstract": "In a concurrent multitasking environment, performing many types of tasks increases task complexity, and working long hours makes a person susceptible to mental fatigue. Emerging technologies may lead to more task interruptions. This study examines the effects of task attributes and mental fatigue on interrupted task performance in a concurrent multitasking environment. Thirty-four participants performed the MATB-Ⅱ under eight conditions (two-level task interruption, two-level task complexity, two-level fatigue). The results revealed the significant interaction effects of interruption × task complexity and of interruption × fatigue state. The findings show that more time is required to return to a complex primary task, and there are differences among subtask types. Mental fatigue negatively affects primary task performance, workload, and the resumption lag after an interruption. The findings are explained by the increasing information cues needed to resume complex tasks and the negative effect of fatigue on memory activation.",

    "abstract": "Heat stress is associated with workplace injuries, likely through a combination of fatigue, reduced cognitive function, and thermal discomfort. The purpose of this study was to evaluate four cognitive tasks for sensitivity to heat stress. Eight participants performed treadmill exercise followed by assessments of serial reaction time (RT), Stroop effect, verbal delayed memory, and continuous performance working memory in an environmental chamber. A control (21.1 °C) trial, and “Hot 1” and “Hot 2” (both 37.8 °C) trials were run sequentially on two separate days to evaluate the four cognitive tasks. Heat strain (comparing Hot 1 and Hot 2 with the control trial) resulted in impairments in the serial RT test response and Stroop accuracy. Delayed memory was impacted only in the Hot 2 trial compared with the control trial. Given the demonstrated impact of heat on cognitive processes relevant to workers’ real-world functioning in the workplace, understanding how to assess and monitor vigilant attention in the workplace is essential.",

In this paper, we describe three cases presented at the 21st Triennial Congress of the International Ergonomics Association to demonstrate how HFE has been applied during the COVID-19 pandemic, namely to (1) develop a mobile diagnostic testing system, (2) understand the changes within physiotherapy services, and (3) guide the transition of a perioperative pain program to telemedicine. We reflect on methodological choices and lessons learned from each case and discuss opportunities to expand the impact of HFE in responses to future emergencies. The HFE discipline should develop faster, less resource intensive but still rigorous, methods, increase available HFE expertise by growing the field, and proactively enhance individual and public perception of the importance of HFE in crisis response.",

    "abstract": "Industrial settings will be characterized by far-reaching production automation brought about by advancements in robotics and artificial intelligence. As a consequence, human assembly workers will need to adapt quickly to new and more complex assembly procedures, which are most likely to increase cognitive workload, or potentially induce overload. Measurement and optimization protocols need to be developed in order to be able to monitor workers’ cognitive load. Previous studies have used electroencephalographic (EEG, measuring brain activity) and electrooculographic (EOG, measuring eye movements) signals, using basic computer-based static tasks and without creating an experience of overload. In this study, EEG and EOG data was collected of 46 participants performing an ecologically valid assembly task while inducing three levels of cognitive load (low, high and overload). The lower individual alpha frequency (IAF) was identified as a promising marker for discriminating between different levels of cognitive load and overload.",

The results provide an overview of the CBRNe (Chemical, Biological, Radiological, Nuclear and explosive) preparedness and response capabilities of railway stakeholders and how these relate to a wider context represented by CBRNe first responders. The results highlight a set of challenges as well as five core skills that railway staff need to develop or improve: 1) understand the specific characteristics of the CBRNe threat, 2) develop basic response measures, 3) cooperate with authorities and train with specialised first responders, 4) improve public awareness about this threat, and 5) optimise crisis communication. In line with these, project PROACTIVE will further help update rail crisis management plans with practical recommendations concerning the CBRNe threat.",

    "doi": "10.1016/j.apergo.2022.103715",
    "abstract": "Objective To investigate the disparity in the specification and physiological demand of a task simulation when developed by two independent panels of experiential experts. Design Independent groups design. Methods Two groups of experiential experts from the Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) worked independently to design, and then complete a simulation of a generic occupational task; the establishment of a security control point. Task duration, oxygen consumption, and cardiac frequency were measured whilst each panel completed the task simulation. Maximal acceptable work duration (MAWD) and the percentage of MAWD (%MAWD) were also calculated. Independent t-tests were used to determine differences (P < 0.05) between the measured variables. Results No differences were observed in the average oxygen consumption (1.26 ± 0.25 L min−1 and 1.28 ± 0.29 L min−1 respectively; P = 0.84), or cardiac frequency (134 ± 16.4 beats·min−1 and 125 ± 8.5 beats·min−1 respectively; P = 0.12) between Panel 1 and Panel 2. However, there was a significant difference between panels with respect to task duration (Panel 1: 15.5 ± 3.68 min; Panel 2: 34.20 ± 9.60 min; P < 0.01), and the %MAWD (Panel 1: 5.32 ± 3.17%, Panel 2: 12.15 ± 9.40%, P = 0.04). Conclusions The physiological demand of a task simulation is dependent upon the group of experts consulted to develop the simulation. It is critical that input from a wide representation of experiential experts is considered when developing task simulations to avoid bias towards the perceptions of the experts consulted.",

    "abstract": "Although sitting on a stability ball has become an alternative to using an office chair, little is known about the increased potential for a fall on the deformable seat. This study examined differences in stability between sitting on a seat pan of a backless office chair and a stability ball during reaching tasks. Sixteen participants performed forward and lateral reaching tasks on a backless and armless office chair and stability ball while whole-body motion and force data under the seat were recorded. Even with participants placing their feet 16.5 cm wider when seated on the ball, the perceived fall risk was significantly greater. Centre of pressure displacement tended to be smaller under the ball for lateral reach directions, but larger during far anterior reaches. While not statistically significant, the medial-lateral margin of stability was on average 3.4 cm smaller on the ball. Despite attempts to increase stability by widening their stance, stability ball fall risk remained higher.",

Participants were asked to type with two mobile devices (i.e., a tablet and a smartphone) under three postures and in two typing styles. Muscle activity was recorded for four upper limb and shoulder muscles on both sides with surface electromyography. Results showed that body posture and typing style yielded significant effects on tying performance, perceived workload, and muscle activities in the forearm, upper arm and shoulder.

    "abstract": "Purpose Three feasible cooling methods for treatment of hyperthermic individuals in the military, that differed considerably in water volume needed (none to ~80 L), were evaluated. Methods Ten male soldiers were cooled following exercise-induced hyperthermia (rectal temperature (Tre) ∼39.5 °C) using ventilation by fanning (1.7 m s−1), ventilation by fanning (1.7 m s−1) while wearing a wet t-shirt (250 mL–27 °C water) and tarp assisted cooling with oscillations (80 L of 27.2 ± 0.5 °C water; TACO). Results Cooling rates were higher using TACO (0.116 ± 0.032 °C min−1) compared to ventilation (0.065 ± 0.011 °C min−1, P<0.001) and ventilation in combination with a wet t-shirt (0.074 ± 0.020 °C min−1, P=0.002). Time to cool (TTC) to Tre=38.2 °C for TACO was shorter (14 ± 4 min) compared to ventilation only (20 ± 5 min; P=0.018), but not to ventilation while wearing a wet t-shirt (18 ± 6 min; P=0.090). Conclusions TACO may be an acceptable, efficient and feasible cooling method in case of exertional heat stroke. However, in case of limited water availability, transportat should be prioritized, and cooling of any form should be implemented while waiting for and during transport.",

    "abstract": "Back support exosuits can support workers in physically demanding jobs by reducing muscle load, which could reduce risk of work-related musculoskeletal disorders. This paper presents a two-session evaluation of a commercial exosuit, the Auxivo LiftSuit 1.1. In session 1, 17 participants performed single repetitions of lifting and static leaning tasks with and without the LiftSuit. In session 2, 10 participants performed 50 box lifting repetitions with and without the LiftSuit. In session 1, the exosuit was considered mildly to moderately helpful, and reduced erector spinae and middle trapezius electromyograms. In session 2, the exosuit was not considered helpful, but reduced the middle trapezius electromyogram and trunk and thigh ranges of motion. These effects are likely due to placement of elastic elements and excessive stiffness at the hips. Overall, the LiftSuit appears suboptimal for long-term use, though elastic elements on the upper back may reduce muscle activation in future exosuit designs.",

    "abstract": "Objective Investigate the influence of sex, strength capacity, and relative load mass on low-back exposure and lower extremity joint power generation in backboard lifting. Background Sex and strength have been shown to influence lifting strategy, but without load mass being scaled to strength it is unknown which factor influences low-back exposures, and whether there are interactions with load mass. Methods Motion capture and force plate data from 28 participants were collected during backboard lifting at load masses scaled to strength capacity. Differences in normalized peak low-back moment, peak knee-to-hip power magnitude ratio and timing were tested as a function of sex, strength, and load mass. Results Stronger participants had lower normalized peak low-back moments (average 32% change from low-capacity across all load masses), with no significant sex effect (p = 0.582). As load mass increased, normalized peak low-back moment, peak knee-to-hip power magnitude and synchronicity decreased. Conclusion Training to both increase strength capacity and hip-joint power generation may be a strategy to reduce low-back exposure in backboard lifting.",

    "abstract": "This case-series study aims to investigate the effects of a passive shoulder support exoskeleton on experienced workers during their regular work shifts in an enclosures production site. Experimental activities included three sessions, two of which were conducted in-field (namely, at two workstations of the painting line, where panels were mounted and dismounted from the line; each session involved three participants), and one session was carried out in a realistic simulated environment (namely, the workstations were recreated in a laboratory; this session involved four participants). The effect of the exoskeleton was evaluated through electromyographic activity and perceived effort. After in-field sessions, device usability and user acceptance were also assessed. Data were reported individually for each participant. Results showed that the use of the exoskeleton reduced the total shoulder muscular activity compared to normal working conditions, in all subjects and experimental sessions. Similarly, the use of the exoskeleton resulted in reductions of the perceived effort in the shoulder, arm, and lower back. Overall, participants indicated high usability and acceptance of the device. This case series invites larger validation studies, also in diverse operational contexts.",

    "abstract": "Few studies have simultaneously explored the training effects of exergame and video game. The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of exergame and video game training on cognitive and physical function in healthy older adults. Eighty-four healthy older adults were randomly assigned to exergame training group, video game training group, and control group. Cognitive and physical function was measured before and after the training. Both training groups improved in verbal memory and aerobic endurance, but the training effects were greater in the exergame training group. The exergame training group also showed significant improvement in lower limb strength and balance. The current study provides evidence that exergame training, incorporating both cognitive engagement and physical activity, exerts greater benefits than cognitively engaging video game training alone. The findings shed lights into the future use of exergame in preventing cognitive and physical function decline in older adults.",

    "abstract": "Improper manual material handling (MMH) techniques are shown to lead to low back pain, the most common work-related musculoskeletal disorder. Due to the complex nature and variability of MMH and obtrusiveness and subjectiveness of existing hazard analysis methods, providing systematic, continuous, and automated risk assessment is challenging. We present a machine learning algorithm to detect and classify MMH tasks using minimally-intrusive instrumented insoles and chest-mounted accelerometers. Six participants performed standing, walking, lifting/lowering, carrying, side-to-side load transferring (i.e., 5.7 kg and 12.5 kg), and pushing/pulling. Lifting and carrying loads as well as hazardous behaviors (i.e., stooping, overextending and jerky lifting) were detected with 85.3%/81.5% average accuracies with/without chest accelerometer. The proposed system allows for continuous exposure assessment during MMH and provides objective data for use with analytical risk assessment models that can be used to increase workplace safety through exposure estimation.",

Articles were classified by determinants of heat exposure risks: core body temperature (direct and indirect), scoring scale including core body temperature, scoring scale including human perception, and others. Heart rate and rectal temperature were the two most utilized physiological measurements. Conclusion A significant amount of literature examined estimation of core temperature using non-invasive methods, sometimes integrated into wearables.

Cybersickness (SSQ) and postural stability (anterior-posterior path-velocity) of new users of VR (n = 80) was collected PRE-VR, POST-VR and 10 min after completing (POST-RECOVERY) a VR gaming experience. Users comprised of videogamers (n = 40) and non-videogamers (n = 40), who were randomly assigned to play either action (high-intensity stimuli) or adventure (low-intensity stimuli) games in VR for 30 min and repeated twice, one week apart. All participants, irrespective of gaming status and genre of game, experienced significant cybersickness after 30 min in VR using current-generation HMD-VR technology, and did not adapt (POST-VR) after two sessions. However videogamers were able to recover (POST-RECOVERY) from cybersickness induced in VR significantly better than non-videogamers. All participants experienced significantly better postural stability after 30 min in VR, irrespective of gaming experience or genre of game. Developers should create VR experiences that minimise negative symptoms of cybersickness and postural instability experience by new users of VR.",

Previous studies examined the differences between DHM's posture and motion prediction relative to human experimental data. Yet, the effect the two different inputs on biomechanical loads was not assessed. Therefore, this study evaluates the differences in L4/L5 compression force and shoulder torques during a work process calculated using DHM with motion prediction (Jack by Siemens) and DHM with experimental data. The work process is a sequential removing, carrying, and depositing task performed by nine females and nine males and recorded using a motion capture system. The analysis shows that using experimental data results in larger back compression force during the removing task (average 15.4%), similar force during the depositing task (average 0.68%), and less force during the carrying task (19.875%). Using experimental data resulted in larger shoulder torque during all tasks (average 24.97%).",

    "abstract": "Background Dual-task interference is a concern when users attempt to use head mounted displays (HMD) while performing seated manual control tasks. Auditory warnings of information displayed on the HMD may or may not assist users while multi-tasking. Objective In this study, we investigated the dual-task interference of words, to be remembered later, presented on a HMD and motor control in a manual tracking task. The word presentations were warned or not warned with auditory signals and the impact of audio warnings were examined. Methods Participants were required to perform five tasks: (1) a compensatory tracking task performed alone, (2) a word memory task performed alone, (3) a tracking and word memory task, (4) a word memory task with words preceded by audial signals, and (5) a tracking and word memory task with words preceded by audial signals. In addition, in the dual-tasks, half of the word presentations were paired with directions changes in the tracking task to test for immediate perceptual interference. Results There were significant dual task costs for both mean tracking error and later word recall. Additionally, participants took significantly longer to respond to motion changes paired with word presentations than motion changes not paired with word presentations. However, the impact of auditory warnings on tracking performance was nuanced. Conclusion Even with an in field of view transparent HMD momentary and sustained cognitive dual-task interference remains. Reaction times are affected most in the worst case scenario, when task critical events occur at the same time as a text message. Application The use of HMDs in time critical manual control tasks (such as operating machinery) should be limited. The use of audial warnings to alert operators to information displayed on an HMD requires further research; it may disrupt appropriate or natural task ordering.",

    "abstract": "Purpose To investigate the effect of sex and load carriage on cardiorespiratory responses to high intensity exercise in male and female soldiers. Methods Soldiers (9 women, 9 men) performed a graded treadmill test until exhaustion with no load (NL) and combat-gear with body armor (CG). Cohen's d effect sizes, paired t-tests and ANOVA were used to study differences between conditions. A mixed linear regression model analyzed the relationship between heart rate (HR) and oxygen uptake (V̇O2) with load and between sexes. Results Wearing CG resulted in, for both sexes, a decreased time to exhaustion (−11 min), lower V̇O2peak (L/min) ES = 0.56; VO2peak (mL//kg/min) ES = 2.44, both p < 0.001, a net decrease in minute ventilation (ES = 3.53) and no change in HRmax. No sex-difference were present except for absolute V̇O2peak. The VO2 and HR relationship showed a cardiorespiratory reduction wearing CG vs. NL. Added load was equal between sexes, although female soldiers' CG relative to body mass was higher (25%) than male soldiers’ (20%), p < 0.01. Conclusion Wearing CG reduces soldiers’ cardiorespiratory capacity and exercise performance level, although the reduction cannot be explained solely based on the added load of CG, instead CG seems to restrict the capacity to fully ventilate. No sex differences were found in relative cardiorespiratory responses to wearing CG compared to NL.",

    "abstract": "A gap exists between the capabilities of artificial intelligence (AI) technologies in healthcare and the extent to which clinicians are willing to adopt these systems. Our study addressed this gap by leveraging ‘expectancy-value theory’ and ‘modified extended unified theory of acceptance and use of technology’ to understand why clinicians may be willing or unwilling to adopt AI systems. The study looked at the ‘expectancy,’ ‘trust,’ and ‘perceptions’ of clinicians related to their intention of using an AI-based decision support system known as the Blood Utilization Calculator (BUC). The study used purposive sampling to recruit BUC users and administered a validated online survey from a large hospital system in the Midwest in 2021. The findings captured the significant effect of ‘perceived risk’ (negatively) and ‘expectancy’ (positively) on clinicians' ‘trust’ in BUC. ‘Trust’ was also found to mediate the relationship of ‘perceived risk’ and ‘expectancy’ with the ‘intent to use BUC.’ The study's findings established pathways for future research and have implications on factors influencing BUC use.",

    "abstract": "Stress impairs motor performance, which is exacerbated with age. Stress also impairs brain activity in the prefrontal cortex, which communicates with the motor areas of the brain to regulate exercise and motor performance. To develop ergogenic strategies for the aging workforce, mind (brain)-body mechanisms behind the effect of stress on neuromuscular performance need to be well understood. This study investigated the influence of social stress on motor performance and information flow between the frontal and motor regions of the brain during intermittent handgrip contractions among older adults. Thirty older adults, balanced by gender, performed intermittent handgrip contractions at 30% of maximum strength before and after being subjected to a social stressor. Force steadiness, strength loss, root mean square electromyogram (EMG) activity, activation of the brain regions, and functional and effective connectivity between the frontal and motor brain regions were computed for pre- and post-stressor handgrip contractions. Older men exhibited improved motor performance after the stressor and concomitant reduction in functional connectivity between the frontal-motor brain regions ipsilateral to the contracting hand. Additionally, while both sexes exhibited significant causal information flow, i.e., effective connectivity, from the frontal to the motor regions of the brain, irrespective of the stressor, older women exhibited a bidirectional effective connectivity between the frontal-motor brain regions after the stressor. Stress had a facilitative effect on the motor performance of older men through compensatory brain network reorganization. Older women exhibited comparable motor performance pre/post stress, despite showing an increase in bidirectional information flow between the frontal-motor areas. Employing brain hemodynamics can facilitate better understanding of the impact of stress on neuromuscular performance and its differential impacts on brain network reorganization between the sexes.",

The letters in focus were designed for this experiment with three variations of open apertures (Open, Medium and Closed).

Decreased time in the provocation maneuver with exoskeletons indicated a negative effect of the HMIs on the vascular and neural supply of the arm. Average pressure in the static situation was 3.2 ± 0.7 kPa and 4.4 ± 0.4 kPa with regular peak values of 6.5 ± 0.5 kPa in the dynamic task. These pressures were significantly higher than the pressure values that guarantee adequate tissue oxygenation. It remains unknown whether the way exoskeletons apply pressure affects vascular and neural supply to the arms, or whether the regular unloading during dynamic activity has a neutralizing effect.",

    "abstract": "Overhead work is an important risk factor associated with musculoskeletal disorders of the neck and shoulder region. This study aimed to propose and evaluate a passive head/neck supporting exoskeleton (HNSE) as a potential ergonomic intervention for overhead work applications. Fourteen male participants were asked to perform a simulated overhead task of fastening/unfastening nut in 4 randomized sessions, characterized by two variables: neck extension angle (40% and 80% of neck maximum range of motion) and exoskeleton condition (wearing and not wearing the HNSE). Using the HNSE, significantly alleviated perceived discomfort in the neck (p-value = 0.009), right shoulder (p-value = 0.05) and left shoulder (p-value = 0.02) and reduced electromyographic activity of the right (p-value = 0.005) and left (p-value = 0.01) sternocleidomastoid muscles. However, utilizing the exoskeleton caused a remarkable increase in right (p-value = 0.04) and left (p-value = 0.05) trapezius electromyographic activities. Performance was not significantly affected by the HNSE. Although the HNSE had promising effects with respect to discomfort and muscular activity in the static overhead task, future work is still needed to investigate its effect on performance and to provide support for the generalizability of study results.",

    "abstract": "This study explored the possibility of applying personalized takeover requests (TORs) in an automated driving system (ADS), which required drivers to regain control when the system reached its limits. A driving simulator experiment was conducted to investigate how speech-based TOR voices impacted driver performance in takeover scenarios with two lead time conditions in conditionally automated driving (level 3). Eighteen participants drove in three sessions, with each session having a different TOR voice (a synthesized male voice, a synthesized female voice, and a significant other voice). Two scenarios with a lead time of 5 s and two scenarios with a lead time of 12 s were provided per session. The driver takeover time and quality data were collected. A follow-up interview was conducted to gain a clearer understanding of the drivers’ psychological feelings about each TOR voice during takeovers. Changes in takeover time and takeover quality caused by TOR voices were similar in both lead time conditions, except for the lateral acceleration. The synthesized male voice led to a larger maximum lateral acceleration than the other two voices in the 5 s condition. Interestingly, most drivers preferred choosing the synthesized female voice for future takeovers and showed negative attitudes toward the significant other voice. Our results implied that choosing TOR voices should consider the drivers’ daily voice-usage habits as well as specific context of use, and personalized TOR voices should be incorporated into the ADS prudently.",

    "abstract": "Human beings play an important role in a smart manufacturing economy. The repetitive and cognitive demanding task operations of smart manufacturing require the development of system models for measuring and predicting human performance, including oil refinery monitoring tasks. The main objective of this research was to validate the generalizability of a mathematical model for the prediction of refinery operators' detection of abnormal events. Moreover, we examined operators' visual behaviors in response to abnormal situations at different ages and with different task loads, task complexities, and input devices. We found that participants had lower mean fixation durations, total fixation numbers, and fixation/saccade ratios when they were in the condition of a touchscreen device. Moreover, we found that older adults had higher mean saccade durations and saccade amplitudes when they were in the condition of a touchscreen device. Finally, the statistical model borrowed from our prior paper was found to be generalizable to different task loads and age groups for the prediction of operators’ detection of abnormal events. Our results showed that visual behaviors can indicate specific internal states of participants, including their cognitive workload, attention, and situation awareness in a real-time manner. The findings provide additional support for the value of using visual behavior to predict responsiveness of oil refinery operators and for future applications of smart manufacturing monitoring systems.",

    "abstract": "Healthcare workers must balance competing priorities to deliver high-quality patient care. Rasmussen's Dynamic Safety Model proposed three factors that organisations must balance to maintain acceptable performance, but there has been little empirical exploration of these ideas, and little is known about the risk trade-offs workers make in practice. The aim of this study was to investigate the different pressures that healthcare workers experience, what risk trade-off decisions they make in response to pressures, and to analyse the implications for quality and safety. The study involved 88.5 h of ethnographic observations at a large, teaching hospital in central London. The analysis revealed five distinct categories of hospital pressures faced by healthcare workers: efficiency, organisational, workload, personal, and quality and safety pressures.

This pre-clinical study aimed to explore immediate and short-term biomechanical responses to changing breast support garment. Asymptomatic participants (n=24) performed a static standing task, drop jumps and seated typing whilst kinematic data from the breasts and spine were recorded. Three breast support conditions were assessed: Usual, professionally fitted bra in the immediate term (PFB), and the same professionally fitted bra after four weeks wear (PFB28). Bra fit assessments were included for both bras. All participants failed the bra fit assessment when wearing the Usual bra and 67% (n=16) failed when wearing the PFB. Less bra fit issues were present in the PFB, resulting in immediate biomechanical changes relating to breast support and spinal posture, yet nothing in the short term (PFB28). This research sets the foundations for future work to investigate whether the implementation of better fitting breast support garments can influence musculoskeletal pain amongst larger breasted women, whilst attributing potential improvement of symptoms, objective measures of breast support and spinal posture.",

This review investigates current uses of vibrotactile feedback systems in motor learning applications built upon virtual environments by systematically synthesizing 24 peer-reviewed studies. We aim to understand: (1) the current state of the science of using real-time vibrotactile feedback in virtual environments for aiding the acquisition (or improvement) of motor skills, (2) the effectiveness of using vibrotactile feedback in such applications, and (3) research gaps and opportunities in current technology. We used the Sensing-Analysis-Assessment-Intervention framework to assess the scientific literature in our review. The review identifies several research gaps in current studies, as well as potential design considerations that can improve vibrotactile feedback systems in virtual motor learning applications, including the selection and placement of feedback devices and feedback designs.",

It was anticipated that being asked to engage in eco-driving behaviours not only has an impact on vehicle fuel usage, but also on the driver, both in terms of their overall mood and willingness to re-engage with the task at a later time. Results from a simulated driving study suggest that although eco-driving was beneficial in reducing fuel consumption, being asked to eco-drive had a negative effect on overall journey time and mood. Engaging in eco-driving did however have a positive effect on self-esteem, suggesting potential longer term psychological benefits of adopting this behaviour.",

    "title": "Underlying mechanisms of fall risk on stairs with inconsistent going size",
    "journal": "Applied Ergonomics",
    "year": "2022",
    "doi": "10.1016/j.apergo.2022.103678",
    "abstract": "Serious falls occur frequently on stairs with inconsistent dimensions. Inconsistent smaller goings are thought to reduce user's foot clearances and foot contact lengths since individuals do not detect and alter their behaviour prior to the inconsistency, increasing the risk of a trip, heel-catch or over-step and potential slip on the stairs. So far, these mechanisms for a stair fall remain theoretical only. The aim of this paper was to identify the underlying mechanisms by which steps with inconsistent going size increase the risk of falls. For this study twenty-seven younger adults (24 ± 3 y, 1.74 ± 0.09 m, 71.41 ± 11.04 kg) and thirty-three older adults (70 ± 4 y, 1.68 ± 0.08 m, 67.90 ± 14.10 kg) ascended and descended a seven-step instrumented staircase in two conditions: 1) consistent dimensions with 200 mm risers and 250 mm goings and 2) inconsistent going dimensions where the going of the third step was reduced by 10 mm, and consequently the going of the second step was larger by 10 mm. Five repeated trials on the inconsistent stairs were performed to assess if there was an adaptation effect after first exposure. In descent in the first inconsistent trial, foot contact lengths were not significantly different between conditions for the younger and older adults on the inconsistently shorter step (∼1%, p = .121). Foot trajectories were pulled further back in the last 22% of swing before contact (p = .025), contradicting previous expectations. Younger adults then had reduced clearances over the next step (∼5 mm, p = .027), which was inconsistently longer, increasing the risk of a heel-catch, whereas foot clearances for older adults were not different. With repeated inconsistent trials the foot contact length of older adults reduced on the shorter step (p = .024). In ascent, in the first inconsistent trial, interaction effects were detected between groups and conditions on three steps: the inconsistently longer step (p = .003), the shorter step (p = .004), the next step (p = .006), as well as on the walkway (p = .048). Older adults positioned themselves further away from the stairs on the walkway compared to younger adults and then had a reduced foot contact length on the inconsistently shorter step (∼2.8%, p = .026), increasing the chances of under-stepping and slipping off the shorter step. Whereas younger adults were positioned closer to the stairs on the walkway, had increased foot contact lengths on the inconsistently longer step and contact lengths that were not different on the inconsistently shorter step. With repeated inconsistent trials, foot contact lengths were reduced on the longer step (p = .006) and then on the shorter step (p = .018). These findings contradict previous assumptions that individuals do not adapt to inconsistent goings on stairs. In descent on the first trial, both groups adjusted their stepping behaviour late in the swing prior to contact with the first inconsistent step. In ascent younger adults made changes to their position and stepping behaviour before stepping on the stairs. These behaviours to mitigate the risk of the inconsistent step, did not persist in the repeat trials. Future investigations should establish the magnitude at which inconsistencies are detectable and can be acted upon and should include a wider range of individuals. This type of research could help inform future initiatives to prevent serious stair falls.",

    "abstract": "The aim of this study was to examine the impact of backpack load carriage on lower limb strength and loading rate change in a cohort that match military recruit profiles. Twenty-six participants walked on a treadmill either carrying a military load carriage system (32 kg) or unloaded for 2 h on two consecutive days. Participants ground reaction forces and strength measures were assessed using a force platform and dynamometry, respectively. Testing included assessments before and after treadmill walking on days one and two, and 24 h following day 2. When assessed by mixed methods ANOVA (alpha: 0.05) statistically significant interaction effects were observed for loading peak (p = 0.031), loading rate (p = 0.035) and plantarflexor torque dynamometry variables at 60°s−1 (p = 0.011) and 120°s−1 (p = 0.024). Repeated measures correlation highlighted associations between plantarflexor torque at 60°s−1 and loading rate (r = −0.901, p < 0.001). Load carriage reduced lower limb torque which did not recover between days. Plantarflexor torque reductions were associated with increases in loading rate. Practitioners should consider that load bearers are more likely to experience lower limb injury during multi-day load carriage. Future work should develop protocols to reduce plantarflexor torque loss in order to reduce ground reaction force change.",

To this end, participants were asked to drive a given path while they either receive a phone call, send voice messages, or send text messages on a given cell phone, as well as a control condition. Driving performance, eye tracking, and subjective measures were collected. The results showed that voice messaging, while not as detrimental to driving performance as texting, does lead to similar levels of visual and cognitive distraction as texting and is generally more distracting than calling. Drivers also seem to be unaware of the dangers of voice messaging while driving.

    "abstract": "Resilient performance in socio-technical systems is usually described as stemming from people's self-organization and spur-of-the-moment actions and decisions. However, this is not exclusive with work system design ahead of time, with the deliberate intention of influencing resilient performance. This paper proposes a concept and principles of Design for Resilient Performance (DfRP), making explicit contributions that had been concealed and fragmented in the literature. Based on a literature review of influential human factors studies, 23 design principles were identified and set a basis for a Delphi study with 27 experts from nine countries. After three Delphi rounds, consensus was obtained and the DfRP concept was defined as well as seven design principles, namely: (i) there must be functional models of the system; (ii) make variations in performance visible; (iii) use the type of standardization that best fits the nature of the function; (iv) design slack resources and strategies; (v) design for acceptable performance even under degraded conditions; (vi) design must involve leveraging diverse perspectives; and (vii) design to support continuous learning at the individual and organisational level. The applicability of the principles is demonstrated through an exploratory case study of the rapid response team in a hospital. The principles of DfRP are contributions of prescriptive nature, which might give rise to more resilient socio-technical systems.",

Research in this area has led to a diversity of ideas regarding potential activation methods. However, little guidance has been provided on how to select among aid activation methods, and this lack of guidance could hinder adaptive aid development and deployment. Within the current paper, we review available methods of aid activation and describe a process for developing and validating adaptive aiding systems. We focus on supporting system designers who wish to select the ideal aid activation method for an intended application. The process that we recommend is an empirical approach to evaluate the feasibility, costs, and benefits of various potential methods of aid activation. This methodological framework will support practitioners making critical decisions about the design of aiding systems.",

The electromyographic activity of the Medial Deltoid (MD) and the Anterior Deltoid (AD) decreased when wearing the exoskeleton. The effect sizes (ES) were, for MD: ES = 0, ES = −0.2, ES = −0.6, ES = −0.3; and for AD: ES = 0.3, ES = −0.6, ES = −0.8, ES = −0.6; for tasks A, B, C and D, respectively. We also found increased Anterior Deltoid/Triceps Brachii co-contraction, a typical joint stabilization mechanism. Wearing the exoskeleton increased the completion time of task B and reduced the perceived effort of tasks A and C, improving overall comfort. These findings are useful to organize the logistics of the workstations that use upper limb exoskeletons to improve the effectiveness of this equipment.",

    "abstract": "Firefighters run a risk of heat strain during occupational tasks. The number of female firefighters has been increasing, but research relevant to this group is still scarce. We aimed to investigate whether there are any sex differences in heat tolerance or physiological responses during uncompensable heat stress while wearing firefighter personal protective equipment. Twelve female (28 ± 7 years, 66 ± 5 kg, 51.7 ± 4.7 mL kg−1 min−1) and 12 male (27 ± 7 years, 83 ± 8 kg, 58.8 ± 7.5 mL kg−1 min−1) participants performed walking (maximum of 60 min) at 6W·kg−1, 40 °C, and 14% relative humidity. No differences were observed between groups in heat tolerance, rectal temperature, heart rate, percent body mass loss, thermal sensation, and rate of perceived exertion. Thus, when personnel are selected using gender-neutral physical employment standards, sex is not an independent factor influencing heat tolerance when wearing firefighter personal protective equipment during uncompensable heat stress.",

    "abstract": "Informal caregivers for persons living with dementia (PLWD) require interventions that incorporate caregiving context. We used the Patient Work System model to characterize caregiving context by identifying work system constraints experienced by caregivers during dementia care events (e.g., managing behavioral symptoms of dementia) and strategies used to overcome constraints. We conducted twenty semi-structured interviews with caregivers. We performed upward abstraction and strategy mapping and identified seven work system constraints and eight strategies used to overcome constraints across three care events. We found that strategies used by caregivers either directly modified a constraint or emphasized other positive work system components to overcome a constraint. For example a caregiver modified their bathroom to support the PLWD in bathing themselves properly and safely. These findings provide an understanding of how real-world context influences how caregivers deliver dementia care and the design and implementation of systems that support dementia caregivers.",

    "abstract": "Recently, ergonomics and safety researchers have turned their attention towards applying combinations of sociotechnical methods rather than using single methods in isolation. In the current research, a mixed-method approach combining two systems-based methods, Accimaps and the Systems Theoretic Accident Model and Process - Causal Analysis using Systems Theory (STAMP-CAST), and one cognitive approach, the Perceptual Cycle Model (PCM), were employed in analysing a rail-level crossing incident in Bangladesh. Each method was applied individually to investigate the collision, and interventions were proposed corresponding to incident events at different risk management framework levels. The three methods provided different perspectives of the whole picture, together identifying an array of contributory factors. The complementary nature of these methods aided in proposing a comprehensive set of safety recommendations, thereby demonstrating the benefit of a mixed-method approach for collision investigation in low-income settings.",

    "abstract": "Few studies have investigated preferred driving posture involving real-world driving. For this purpose, seven preferred joint angles of 127 participants were recorded three times from sagittal plane photographs after a short, standardized drive on public roads. Participants' individual driving posture preferences were determined using a word-based questionnaire. The inter- and intraindividual joint angle differences were calculated and some significant effects of stature, age, and gender on these joint angle differences were found. Additionally, significant correlations were found between posture preferences and joint angles, except for the lower extremities. The results show that the factors stature, age, gender, and posture preferences have influence on the preferred joint angles. However, other human-, vehicle-, and context-related factors also seem relevant and should be considered in future studies. The results provide important field-based knowledge for an application-oriented understanding of driving posture and for the human-centered design process of future vehicle interior research and development.",

    "doi": "10.1016/j.apergo.2021.103615",
    "abstract": "Studying the acceptance of exoskeletons in industry has gained increased attention. Exoskeletons (wearable support devices) are envisioned to alleviate heavy work. Examining what factors influence the use of exoskeletons is important, because influencing these factors could positively contribute to the adoption of industrial exoskeletons. The factors identified in this paper have been systematically derived from empirical research with (potential future) end users, most of whom have tried on an exoskeleton. Our framework with factors influencing the acceptance of industrial exoskeletons can be used during the (ideally iterative) design, (re)development and evaluation phase of new or existing exoskeletons. This could improve the quality of exoskeletons since this allows designers to already consider acceptance factors early in the design process instead of finding out what is important late in the design process during (field) testing. In turn, this might accelerate the adoption of exoskeletons. Also, our framework can be used to study the ongoing introduction of exoskeletons at work since it also addresses policy decisions companies interested in implementing exoskeletons should consider.",

    "abstract": "Trust is a critical factor that drives successful human-automation interaction in a myriad of modern professional environments. One seminal work on human-automation trust is Muir and Moray (1996) showing that human-machine trust evolves from faith, then dependability, and finally predictability in a simulated supervisory control task. However, our recent work failed to replicate the finding of the original study, calling for further replication efforts. Experiment 1 aimed to fully replicate Muir and Moray (1996) where participants performed a simulated pasteurizer task. Experiment 2 attempted to replicate Experiment 1 using participants who major in Engineering as used in the original study. Both experiments showed that dependability was the best initial predictor of trust, building later to predictability and faith. Two experiments consistently failed to support both the hypothesis proposed by Muir and Moray (1996), that trust develops from predictability to dependability to faith, and their original findings that trust develops initially from faith. The results of the current experiments challenge this widely cited view of how human-machine trust develops. Modern automation designers should be aware that dependability might control initial trust development for general users and incorporate dependability information into their designs.",

This systematic review aimed to identify accessible and validated tools, for the assessment of workplace physical and psychosocial hazards, and consolidate the results into a matrix for use by work health and safety (WHS) professionals. Web of Science, Medline, ProQuest Central, and PsychInfo electronic databases, along with grey literature, were searched (Jan 1990 to July 2020). Studies that included tools with evidence of validity for the identification of physical hazards, psychosocial hazards, or both were included. A total of 83 tools were identified and then reviewed to ensure the tools were accessible. The final matrix included a total of 26 tools (16 physical, 4 psychosocial, and 6 comprehensive [physical and psychosocial]). Evidence on best practice for MSD mitigation supports the need for a comprehensive approach; however, the current review identified limitations in the availability of such tools to support WHS professionals.",

These interactions then carry implications for workforce retention, public safety, workplace relations and supports. To better understand such interactions, this study used thematic networks and system dynamics (causal loop diagrams) analysis with the aim to unearth a global theme underscoring occurrence of WRMSDs, and describe the factors influencing the system dynamics of WRMSD occurrence in tram drivers. Building on earlier work focused on occupational participation, secondary analysis of driver interviews (n = 13) and driving observations (n = 11) produced thematic network and causal loop models of risk factors that highlighted an Injury by Design problem structure as a global theme. Research targeting organisational culture, human factors, and design standards is needed to minimise WRMSDs risk in tram drivers.",

    "abstract": "This paper provides a review of studies containing safety and ergonomic outcomes in lean manufacturing (LM) environments over the past 40 years. The aim is to identify effects from specific LM methods on specific safety/ergonomic outcomes, to understand the relationship in greater detail. One hundred and one studies containing one hundred and seventy outcomes were identified. Thirty-seven outcomes pertained to just-in-time (JIT) production, which contained twenty-three negative, eleven neutral, and three positive safety/ergonomic outcomes. Conversely, twenty-six outcomes pertained to 5S and consisted of twenty-four positive, two negative, and no neutral outcomes. The most common negative JIT outcome was stress and mental strain, while the most common positive 5S outcome was a tie between safety performance and hazard exposure. Studies containing other methods were fewer in number with more mixed outcomes. These findings suggest that individual LM methods, especially JIT and 5S, uniquely contribute to the safety/ergonomic outcomes attributed to LM.",

If consumers are to safely handle such products, they need to be aware of the risks posed by the particular product they are using. Although most countries require that chemical household products feature warning labels (e.g. the Globally Harmonized System of Classification and Labelling of Chemicals), consumers appear to also use other cues to determine the risks associated with a specific product. Thus, we studied the influence of packaging on consumers' risk perception of chemical household products. More specifically, we examined the effect of the colour of the packaging (black or pink packaging versus the original packaging) as well as the presence of images of flowers or food-imitating elements on the packaging. Significant differences with regard to consumer's risk perception were found in terms of all four studied manipulations. Therefore, we conclude that consumers' risk perception can be influenced by the packaging design. In particular, if elements that lower consumer's risk perception (e.g. featuring flowers on the label and food-imitating elements on the packaging) are omitted from the packaging, consumers might be able to more accurately judge the risks associated with a product and so take appropriate safety precautions.",

    "abstract": "Anthropometry and human perception lie at the core of the ergonomic design process. Until now, relevant studies have been quite restricted, being unable to provide a holistic view of the perceived comfort and fit for ear-related products. The study examined the perceived comfort and fit using factor analysis and established a linkage between anthropometry and human perception for design uses. A total of 30 participants (15 male, 15 female) were recruited in the within-subject experiment. The results showed that ear symmetry, gender, concha length, and cavum concha width had either insignificant or weak correlation with the perception scores. Use condition and product size significantly influenced the perceived comfort and fit for ear-related products. Users preferred a larger product size in the dynamic condition than in the static condition. Moreover, the study proposed a novel method to quantify the relationship between anthropometric data and human perception for the ear-related product. For an in-the-ear product, trendlines were generated to link the product size based on 3D anthropometry with the comfort and fit scores.",

    "abstract": "User Interface (UI) design practices often abide by popular usability heuristics such as Nielsen’s (1994) “10 usability heuristics for user interface design” or Gerhardt–Powals' (1996) cognitive engineering principles. To examine the underlying mechanism of user performance enhancement by following some of these usability heuristics, we compared user performance between two device conditions: one representing design practices following two selected sets of usability heuristics (experimental condition) and the other without following them (control condition). As a research framework, we adopted the psychological–refractory–period (PRP) paradigm along with the locus–of–slack logic, a well–established dual–task paradigm for examining the nature of cognitive benefits caused by experimental manipulations. Results showed that the experimental–device condition that followed the usability heuristics yielded faster performance than the control condition, especially when the stimulus–onset–asynchrony between the two tasks was long than when it was short. According to the locus–of–slack logic, these results suggest that the nature of cognitive benefits caused by following the usability heuristics is more likely to be due to shortening of the response–activation stage (rather than the response–selection stage). These findings suggest that following the two usability heuristics tends to facilitate a specific stage of the information processes more than other stages.",

    "abstract": "This study aims to quantify the stresses of sonographers using two different ultrasound devices, one of conventional and one of ergonomic design. A total of 20 obstetricians and gynecologists participated in this study, and two types of tasks (scanning and positioning) were evaluated while using the two different devices. To quantify workload, four dependent variables (muscle activity, estimated grip force, subjective comfort rating, and task time) were measured. The muscular activity required while using the conventional device was 14.4% MVC (Maximum voluntary contraction) for the scanning task, which was significantly higher than that of the ergonomic device. The subjective comfort rating for the conventional design was lower than that of the ergonomic design. For the positioning task, the ergonomic device (33.2% MVC) resulted in significantly higher muscle activity in the extensor digitorum (ED) and flexor digitorum superficialis (FDS) than the conventional design (22.2% MVC), whereas the deltoid muscle showed significantly lower activity than in users of conventional design (4.5% MVC). Ergonomically-designed ultrasound devices improve ease of moving and the probe's supporters, reduce physical load and increase ease of use for sonographers. Our results may be used as guidelines for usability testing of ultrasound devices.",

The aim of this study was to objectively evaluate thermal properties of ten tabletop materials as well as user perceptions of those materials after use. Sixteen participants tested ten materials in a randomised order. Infrared thermography was used to determine tabletop temperature distribution and change. Materials with lower thermal effusivity (wood-based materials) in general reached higher surface temperature differences after 15 min of contact and were rated as more pleasant to touch, more suitable for writing, and more liked for everyday use. Participants’ sex and forearm mass had no effect on the temperature after contact. Participants gave the highest ratings to the appearance of oak-based materials. Surface treatment affected subjective evaluation of the materials. The tabletop made of lacquered solid wood had the most favourable thermal and user-rated characteristics.",

    "abstract": "Netherlands Railways has developed driver advisory systems (DAS) to provide the train driver with route context information and coasting advice in order to benefit punctuality and energy efficiency. However, the impact of these DAS on human factors aspects and safety performance is unclear. The current study assesses the impact of two DAS levels (route context information and coasting advice) on mental workload, attention allocation and safety performance, using eye tracking, a subjective mental workload rating scale (RSME) and simulator data. The overall findings suggest that the application of DAS levels has no negative impact on safety performance and attention allocation towards the trackside compared to a control condition with static timetable information. Furthermore, safety performance benefits significantly from DAS with route context information. DAS were originally developed to benefit punctuality and energy efficiency goals. This study implicates that DAS can also benefit safety performance. The current study found that DAS could decrease workload when the functionalities meet the requirements of the situation. The possible presence of mental underload and its effect on driving performance should be taken into consideration when implementing DAS. It is essential in the development of DAS that it meaningfully enriches the train driving task in stead of simply increasing mental workload.",

    "abstract": "This study examines the impact of the sound environment on spatial knowledge acquisition in a virtual outpatient polyclinic. Outpatient polyclinics have a salient role in determining early outpatient treatments of COVID-19 to prevent hospitalization or death and reduce the burden on hospitals. However, they have not been widely investigated in the literature. The studies on spatial knowledge have identified environmental elements mainly related to vision with no focus on sound. Currently, there is limited research on the effect of sound environment on spatial knowledge acquisition in virtual outpatient polyclinics. In this study, a virtual simulated outpatient polyclinic has been created with varying levels of visual and audio cues. Eighty participants were assigned to one of the four groups: a control (no visual signage), a visual (visual signage), an only audio (no landmarks and no visual signage), and an audio-visual group. The virtual environment was presented as a video walkthrough with passive exploration to test spatial knowledge acquisition with tasks based on the landmark-route-survey model. The results showed that a combination of visual signage and sound environment resulted in higher spatial knowledge acquisition. No significant difference was found between the performance of the visual group and the control group that shows that signage alone cannot aid spatial knowledge in virtual outpatient polyclinics. Data from the only audio group suggests that landmarks associated with sound can compensate for the lack of visual landmarks that may help design a wayfinding system for users with visual disabilities.",

    "abstract": "Inhibitory control, the ability to inhibit impulsive responses and irrelevant stimuli, enables high level functioning and activities of daily living. The Simon task probes inhibition using interfering stimuli, i.e., cues spatially presented on the opposite side of the indicated response; incongruent response times (RT) are slower than congruent RTs. Operational applicability of the Simon task beyond finger/hand manipulations and visual/auditory cues is unclear, but important to consider as new technologies provide tactile cues and require motor responses from the lower extremity (e.g., exoskeletons). In this study, twenty participants completed the Simon task under four conditions, each combination of two cue (visual/tactile) and response (upper/lower-extremity) modalities. RT were significantly longer for incongruent than congruent cues across cue-response pairs. However, alternative cue-response pairs yielded slower RT and decreased accuracy for tactile cues and lower-extremity responses. Results support operational usage of the Simon task to probe inhibition using tactile cues and lower-extremity responses relevant for new technologies like exoskeletons and immersive environments.",

Methods Two hundred women were surveyed to determine the most common mopping system, mopping patterns and type of flooring used in their homes. The biomechanical demands of the three most common mopping systems were then evaluated in the laboratory. Participants were also asked to rate their perceived levels of exertion and cleanliness of each mopping system. Results The use of wet wipes had the highest repetition count and exertion rates during mopping and scrubbing tasks. Higher peak scrubbing forces were noted for the plunge mop. All participants found the cotton fibre mop to be the cleanest. All 3 mops had medium postural risk. Conclusion The advantages and disadvantages of each mopping system were outlined and may be used by occupational therapists when providing ergonomic advice to patients with upper limb musculoskeletal conditions.",

    "abstract": "Introduction Incident reporting and learning systems are a fundamental component of safety management. The purpose of this study was to evaluate a novel incident reporting system specific to the Australian Led Outdoor Activity (LOA) sector. The Understanding and Preventing Led Outdoor Accidents Data System (UPLOADS), is a recently introduced systems thinking-based incident reporting and learning system that utilises contemporary safety theory and methods. Method The implementation of UPLOADS was evaluated using the RE-AIM framework based on the following dimensions: Reach, Efficacy, Adoption, Implementation, and Maintenance. A pragmatic evaluation approach was used in which evaluation data were collected through the triangulation of multiple sources including different LOA stakeholders from both the individual organisational level (LOA providers) and LOA sector governance level (LOA industry representatives), incident data collected through the UPLOADS National Incident Dataset, and the online and physical presence of UPLOADS. Results The findings show that a key strength of UPLOADS is its effectiveness as incident reporting tool for improving safety in the LOA sector. However, a weakness of UPLOADS is that it is not being implemented appropriately by the LOA providers. Conclusion Overall, the current findings suggest that UPLOADS incident reporting tool is perceived by SMEs as an effective tool for improving safety in LOA. However, further work is required for UPLOADS to have a greater impact on the LOA sector. Specifically, Implementation of the UPLOADS system requires improvement, as well as additional training and education may be required to upskill and empower LOA providers to improve reporting and enhance the value placed on safety by LOA stakeholders. The RE-AIM framework was an appropriate evaluation framework for understanding the effectiveness of UPLOADS as a LOA sector specific incident reporting and learning system. Practical applications The current findings have practical implications for ergonomics researchers applying evaluation frameworks in the real world, and LOA providers for implementing safety interventions. Lastly, contemporary systems-based incident reporting and learning systems have the capability to enhance the safety practices of the LOA sector.",

Automation and smart alarms can enhance these processes. This study investigated the effects of alarm management and automation on process control operator workload (NASA-TLX) and performance via material lost through flaring outcomes. Eleven console qualified operators participated in a human-in-the-loop, high-fidelity simulation-based training exercise. Three levels of alarm management (no rationalization, rationalization, and state-based smart alarm) and two levels of automation (no automation and automation) conditions were implemented using six scenarios. A repeated measures two-way MANOVA indicated that both alarm management schema and automation significantly affected operator workload and performance. These results indicate that state-based smart alarm management and automation schemas may assist operators in reducing workload and material lost through flare release during abnormal operating conditions.",

    "abstract": "Complaints of musculoskeletal pain are common among employees who stand for prolonged periods. This study sought to determine if an anti-fatigue mat (AFM) could uniquely affect low back pain (LBP), low back posture, and foot-floor interface responses in individuals prone to developing LBP (termed pain developers (PDs)) during prolonged standing experiments compared to those who do not develop LBP under the same exposures (termed non pain developers (NPDs)). Sixteen volunteers (8 PDs and 8 NPDs) were recruited based on their pain-development tendencies, which were established in previous standing experiments. They visited the laboratory on two separate days for 60 min of light manual work while standing on either a rigid floor or AFM. All participants were asymptomatic at the beginning of each experimental session. The amount of LBP experienced during the standing exposure, measured via a visual analogue scale, was reduced (p = 0.03) in the PD group when on the AFM (3.6 ± 6 mm) compared to the rigid floor (6.8 ± 7 mm). LBP levels remained low and unchanged (p = 0.5) between the AFM (2.4 ± 5 mm) and rigid floor (1.6 ± 2 mm) conditions for the NPD group. Neither postural nor foot-floor interface measures correlated with this unique reduction of LBP for the PD group when standing on the AFM. The AFM did, however, increase centre of pressure excursion (NPD 55% increase; PD 35% increase) and tended to increase the number of body weight shifts (NPD 116% increase; PD 54% increase) in both the PD and NPD groups. These findings suggest that AFMs may selectively benefit individuals prone to developing standing-induced back pain by facilitating subtle movements at the foot-floor interface.",

    "abstract": "To better understand the assessment of motor variability (MV) in an occupational context, this study determined the role of task constraints on MV and consistency in individual MV responses. Twenty participants performed repetitive lifting under four constraints differing in restriction of foot movement and load weight. MV was assessed for three body regions and for the whole-body using linear variability of three-dimensional joint angles. Foot movement caused significant increases of lower body (11–17%), low back (318–439%) and a reduction in upper body variability (4%), whereas no effects of weight nor interaction of foot restriction and weight were found. Good individual consistency (ICC = 0.71–0.84) was demonstrated across constraints. Even though MV is affected by constraints, this study supports that MV is largely an individual trait independent of constraints. Future work should evaluate if MV remains an individual trait across different tasks, and if MV is confounded by other task constraints.",

    "abstract": "Background Health information technologies (HITs) are increasingly being used to support the self-management of chronic diseases. However, patients’ initial or continued acceptance of such technologies is not always achieved. Objective The aim of this study was to develop a theory-driven HIT acceptance model to examine factors affecting acceptance of HIT (measured by behavioral intention; BI) for disease self-management among patients with chronic diseases, in which we also focused on three additional, previously unexplored factors related to perceived hand function (PHF), perceived visual function (PVF), and perceived space adequacy (PSA) and a longitudinal scrutinization of changes in the effects of these factors on acceptance over time. Methods The theoretical basis of our acceptance model was drawn from the technology acceptance model and the theory of planned behavior. The model was further extended by including patients' PHF, PVF (related to patients with chronic diseases who are mostly elderly), and PSA (related to the patients’ home environment). The model was tested in the context of type 2 diabetes and hypertension self-management via a touchscreen tablet-based system over a 24-week period. A questionnaire was administered at four time points (baseline and 8, 16, and 24 weeks after implementation) to collect data from 151 patients with coexisting type 2 diabetes and hypertension. We tested the model at each time point using partial least squares structural equation modeling. Results Perceived usefulness of the self-management system influenced BI directly at 8 and 24 weeks and indirectly at 8, 16, and 24 weeks. Perceived ease of use indirectly affected BI at 8, 16, and 24 weeks. Attitude directly affected BI at 8, 16, and 24 weeks. Perceived behavioral control directly influenced BI at baseline and 8 and 16 weeks. Subjective norms indirectly influenced BI at 8, 16, and 24 weeks. PHF and PVF indirectly influenced BI over the entire study period. PSA influenced BI directly at 16 weeks and indirectly at 8, 16, and 24 weeks. Conclusion The effects of the proposed factors in our model on patient-focused HIT acceptance changed over a longer time period, emphasizing the importance of further investigation of the longitudinal mechanisms influencing technology acceptance behavior. It is recommended that healthcare practitioners consider such changes when implementing comparable technologies. Moreover, beyond technology attributes, the characteristics, needs, and limitations of older adults and elderly patient users and their home environments should also be considered in the design and implementation of patient-focused HIT systems for chronic disease self-management at home.",

    "abstract": "During a driving task, the seat-driver interface is particularly influenced by the external environment and seat features. This study compares the effect of two different seats (S1 – soft & S2 – firm) and the effect of visual simulation of different road types (city, highway, mountain, country), on pressure distribution and perceived discomfort during prolonged driving. Twenty participants drove two 3-h sessions (one per seat) on a static simulator. Contact Pressure (CP), Contact Surface (CS), and Seat Pressure Distribution Percentage (SPD%) were analyzed throughout, using two pressure mats positioned on seat cushion and backrest. Whole-body and local discomfort for each body part were rated every 20 min. The softer seat, S1, induced a greater contact surface on cushion and backrest and a lower SPD%, reflecting better pressure distribution. Pressure profiles were asymmetrical for both S1 and S2, with higher CP under left buttock (LBu) and right lower back (RLb) and greater CS under thighs and RLb. Pressure distribution was less homogeneous on mountain and city roads than on monotonous roads (highway and country). Despite the pressure differences between the seats, however, both led to similar increases in perceived whole-body discomfort throughout the driving session. Moreover, the highest discomfort scores were in the neck and the lower back areas, whatever the seat. These findings on pressure variables may have implications for the design of backrests and cushions to ensure more homogeneous pressure distribution, even though this is not shown to minimize perceived driver discomfort.",

    "abstract": "In order to manage the performance of socio-technical systems in a safe and sustainable way, the importance of looking at human and organisational factors (HOF) and their contribution to adverse events is widely recognised. In reality, however, the scope of accident and incident investigations stays usually limited to investigating the immediate causes and decision-making processes related to the accident sequence (e.g. Antonsen, 2009). Important factors, including design and planning decisions, contributing to accidents are hereby often overlooked and the weaknesses in the Safety Management System are hardly ever analysed. The SAfety FRactal ANalysis (SAFRAN) method (Accou and Reniers, 2019) can guide investigators in an intuitive and logic way, to ask questions that help to gain deeper understanding of the capability of organisations to monitor and manage safety critical variability. The essence of using the SAFRAN method for evaluating the performance of the different processes in a socio-technical system, is to approach them in a similar way, building on the generic elements that compose a SMS and systematically looking at the HOF that influenced actions and decision making, regardless of the hierarchical level they are situated at. This paper presents the SAFRAN method, specifying its HOF taxonomy and sharing examples of supporting HOF questions. The approach enables non-experts in HOF to systematically identify the different elements that introduce critical variability in performance and to recognise what additional expertise can be called upon when needed.",

    "abstract": "Nurses function at the point of care and assume a significant role in intercepting errors. They work in a mentally and physically demanding profession that is comprised of shift-work, subjecting nurses to considerable fatigue. Yet, few studies constructed a comprehensive model that integrates personal and occupational factors to explore their relationship with various types of fatigue (acute, chronic, physical, mental, and total). Here, we examine this type of comprehensive fatigue-model, in a report that represents one aim of a larger, mixed-methods study. The study sample comprised of 1137 registered nurses working in eight hospitals in a Midwestern state. Nurses reported higher levels of acute and total fatigue than chronic and physical fatigue. Staffing and resource adequacy, exercise, and sleep were among the strongest predictors. Since fatigue is a multi-faceted construct, a comprehensive fatigue-management strategy that targets both day and night-shift nurses is the optimal way to manage nurse fatigue.",

    "abstract": "Exoskeletons have shown significant impact at reducing the biomechanical demand on muscles during repetitive lifting and overhead tasks in non-healthcare industries. However, the benefits of exoskeletons are yet to be realized in the operating room, particularly as work-related musculoskeletal disorders continue to be a concern for surgeons. This study quantified the effect of using neck, arm, and trunk exoskeletons on muscle activity while assuming typical postures held in the operating room. Fourteen participants were recruited to participate in this study. In this two-part experiment participants were asked to 1) hold a series of neck flexion, arm abduction and trunk flexion postures seen in surgical procedures, and 2) perform a simulated surgical task requiring five different trunk flexion posture levels. Participants were required to complete these tasks with and without passive exoskeleton(s). This study showed that even for postures held short time periods, exoskeletons are beneficial at reducing the demand on muscles; however, the reduction in muscle demand depends on body segment and postural angle, as intended with these passive exoskeletons. Furthermore, for the simulated surgical task with awkward trunk flexion postures (10–65°), the trunk exoskeletons showed a significant reduction in the rate of rise in back muscle sEMG (+1.365%MVC/min vs. +0.769%MVC/min for non-dominant lumbar extensor muscles, p = 0.0108; +1.377%MVC/min vs. +0.770%MVC/min for the dominant lumbar extensor muscles, p = 0.0196) over 25 min, consequently resulting in improved trunk subjective discomfort scores (7.34 vs. 4.30, p < 0.05), with no impact on the neck and shoulder biomechanical demand. The results from this study indicate that exoskeletons may be a potential intervention to reduce biomechanical loading during surgery.",

    "abstract": "Ecological Interface Design (EID) is a framework for developing dynamic interfaces that support operators to understand and take appropriate actions within highly-complex systems. This two-part study involved the development and evaluation of a novel EID-based static aviation risk management display. A within-subjects survey-based experiment employed measures of decision accuracy, situation awareness, user workload, usability, and user perceptions. Results from 23 participants showed that when compared to a risk interface utilised by a large aviation company, the EID display achieved higher usability and lower workload ratings with large effect sizes, with no differences in decision accuracy and situation awareness. The findings provide evidence that the EID framework can improve upon static traditional displays. Research contributions also include a novel model of an aviation ground operations system and an example application of EID to the development of a static display. Further research is necessary to identify the extent of the applications and benefits to static displays.",

    "abstract": "Low back disorders (LBDs) are a leading injury in the workplace. Back exoskeletons (exos) are wearable assist devices that complement traditional ergonomic controls and reduce LBD risks by alleviating musculoskeletal overexertion. However, there are currently no ergonomic assessment tools to evaluate risk for workers wearing back exos. Exo-LiFFT, an extension of the Lifting Fatigue Failure Tool, is introduced as a means to unify the etiology of LBDs with the biomechanical function of exos. We present multiple examples demonstrating how Exo-LiFFT can assess or predict the effect of exos on LBD risk without costly, time-consuming electromyography studies. For instance, using simulated and real-world material handling data we show an exo providing a 30 Nm lumbar moment is projected to reduce cumulative back damage by ∼70% and LBD risk by ∼20%. Exo-LiFFT provides a practical, efficient ergonomic assessment tool to assist safety professionals exploring back exos as part of a comprehensive occupational health program.",

This study conducted two experiments to identify an easy operation area. In experiment 1, the influence of control size and control position on click offsets was discussed. The results showed that click offsets increased with increasing control size. Click offsets were larger at positions blocked by a driver's arm and that were far away from drivers. The click accuracy equation was fitted for different hot zone sizes. Experiment 2 focused on identifying easy sliding ranges. The results revealed sliding areas for 20%, 50%, and 80% of users under different sliding directions and positions. This study identified easy and difficult areas for users to operate large in-vehicle touch screens, providing theoretical guidance for display buttons arrangement.",

    "abstract": "When more than one audible alarm is heard simultaneously, discrimination may be compromised. This experiment compares near-simultaneous clinical alarms in two styles, the first are the tonal ‘melodies’ from the 2012/2006 version of a global medical device safety standard (IEC 60601-1-8) and the second are the auditory-icon-style recommended in the 2020 version of the same standard. Sixty-six participants were required to identify the meaning and priority of four different clinical alarms for one of the two styles of alarm (between-subjects). Alarms sounded both singly and in pairs (within-subjects). Results showed that the auditory icon alarms outperformed the tonal alarms on all measures except one, both for overall accuracy (recognizing both priority and function) and for partial accuracy (recognizing priority or function but not both). The results add to the growing body of evidence supporting the use of auditory icon alarms in clinical environments.",

    "abstract": "It is well known that exposure to light at the right time of the day is important to synchronise our circadian rhythm and enhance cognitive functioning. There is, however, a lack of field studies investigating which lighting characteristics are necessary to improve sleep and cognitive functioning. A controlled field study with 80 shift workers was set up, in which the impact of an integrative lighting (IL) scenario was investigated during the morning shift. Two groups were compared: a control group (no change in lighting settings) and a IL-group (exposed to a melanopic Equivalent Daylight Illuminance of 192 lux, i.e., bright light with a high fraction of short-wavelengths). Pre-post measurement of visual comfort, cognitive functioning (D2 task, go-nogo reaction time task) and sleep (MotionWatch8) were performed. The IL-settings ameliorated sleep efficiency and sleep latency during morning shift and enhanced alertness (not inhibition) compared to standard lighting conditions. Changing lighting settings in an industrial setting should be considered as it seems worthwhile for employees’ sleep and cognitive performance.",

In esports, the effect of gaming peripherals on performance has only recently been explored. In this study, we investigated the effect of computer mouse mass on gaming skill. 72 video game players performed a target acquisition task, a pertinent composite skill in first-person shooter (FPS) video games, while using computer mice that varied only by their mass (50g, 60g, 90g & 100g). Results showed that participants were 4% faster and 9% more accurate with 50g, 60g, and 90g mice compared to the 100g mouse. They were also 34% more accurate and 14% more precise when using lower control-display gain and preferred lighter mice (50g and 60g) when performing the skill at a lower control-display gain. Taken together, using a lighter mouse at lower sensitivity may augment target acquisition performance among video gamers.",

    "abstract": "There have been recent calls for Human Factors and Ergonomics (HFE) to expand its reach and focus to address larger scale societal and global issues. An area of growing awareness is the issue of the gender data gap, whereby women are under-represented in research data, leading to inequitable outcomes when research findings are used to design real world technologies, products, environments, processes, and policies. The aim of this paper is to showcase how structured HFE methods can be used to address the gender data gap. We applied the Sociotechnical Systems Design Toolkit which involved using causal loop diagrams and abstraction hierarchy modelling from Cognitive Work Analysis to understand the system in which the issue occurs and key pain points, followed by the application of the Design with Intent Toolkit to generate design ideas. A total of 43 ideas were developed that could be implemented by universities to address the research data gap. The application demonstrates the utility of HFE methods in tackling complex issues and offers an opportunity for the HFE community to reflect upon the importance of gender sensitive research practices and gender equity more broadly.",

    "abstract": "This study compares human climbing performance, including climbing speed and movement and force patterns, between rail- and rung-climbing styles for a moderate aerial ladder slope (52.5°). Hand and foot movements and forces were recorded for 9 male and 10 female firefighters as they ascended and descended a 3.4-m ladder using elevated handrails (rail-climbing) or rungs (rung-climbing) for hand support. The results indicated that climbers used three or more points of contact 54% of the time for rung-climbing and 100% of the time for rail-climbing. Furthermore, rail-climbing was 10% faster than rung-climbing. In rail-climbing, the lateral hand forces were mostly directed away from the body; while during rung-climbing, they were alternated in lateral and medial directions. Overall, the results suggested that rail-climbing provides better control over body positioning and faster climbing speed. Furthermore, the continuous contact of both hands in rail-climbing may reduce the fall risk by facilitating the recovery from a slip or perturbation.",

The wake after sleep onset was less by 23 ± 3 min for night shifts and 22 ± 3 min for day shifts (p < 0.05 for all). The prevalence of risk for sleep apnea was 31%, insomnia was 8%, and shiftwork disorder was 44%. Average alertness for all working hours was 75%.

    "abstract": "There is a recent trend to place more emphasis on noise non-auditory effects. Despite its implications on health, there is a lack of recommendations for noise in occupational settings. This study aimed to present occupational exposure limits for noise-induced non-auditory effects in healthy males using empirical exposure-response regression models based on the data of laboratory and ﬁeld considering the effective variables. To this end, the equivalent noise level was measured and recorded in four working settings including closed offices, open-plan offices, control rooms, and industrial workplaces during a normal working day. They were 65, 68, 73, and 80dB(A), respectively. In the laboratory, 31 healthy males were exposed to five noise conditions (four noisy conditions and one quiet) during 8 h and they were asked to perform the cognitive tests. In the ﬁeld phase, 124 healthy males were also examined from four working settings in their workstations for 8 h. The psychophysiological parameters of the participants were recorded in both lab and field. The results indicated variations in mental responses at levels above 55dBA, and psychophysiological variations at levels above 70dB(A) in both phases. The findings also showed that the developed regression models could plausibly predict the noise-induced psychophysiological responses during exposure to noise levels; thus, they can be presented the likely exposure limits. Based on the results of the models, the levels <55dB(A) are likelihood of the acoustic comfort limit, and the levels ranged from 55 to 65dB(A) are the acoustic safe limits. The acoustic caution limit is the likelihood of the levels ranged from 65 to 75dB(A). The levels ranged from 75 to 80dB(A) are likely the action levels or control limits, and the occupational exposure limit are the probability of levels> 80dB(A).",

    "abstract": "Historically, PPE (Personal Protective Equipment) has generally been designed around the size and shape of an average European or US white man's face and body. There is little academic evidence to support anecdotal reports that women are at a greater disadvantage than men from ill-fitting PPE. This is especially relevant in healthcare settings where women make up at least 75% of frontline workers. The COVID-19 pandemic has exacerbated problems associated with the fit of PPE that until now have been mainly anecdotal. This research presents results and analysis of a quantitative and qualitative survey concerning the fit of PPE worn by 248 healthcare workers, in a variety of healthcare roles and settings, during the COVID-19 pandemic. The analysis of the survey results showed that women were less likely than men to feel safe carrying out their roles, with only 30.5% of women and 53.3% of men stating that they felt safe all of the time. A statistically significant link is made between women suffering more with poor fit than men with certain categories of PPE (gowns, masks, visors, goggles). Over four times as many women (54.8%) as men (13.3%) reported their surgical gowns being large to some degree and women were nearly twice as likely (53.5%) to experience oversized surgical masks than men (28.6%). However, it was recognized that PPE fit problems are not exclusive to women as many men also do not conform to the underlying shape and size of PPE designs. Survey results indicated that both sexes felt equally hampered due to the fit of their PPE and around a third of both women and men had modified their PPE to address fit issues. Oversized and modified PPE presents its own set of unintended consequences. Following strict processes for doffing and removing PPE is key to virus control but doffing modified PPE can fall outside of these processes, risking cross infection. In addition, wearers of critical items of PPE (such as respirators) currently undergo a “fit test”; however, fit does not reconcile with comfort and over-tightened PPE can cause headaches, discomfort and distraction when worn for long periods. Requirements and fit tests are also not setting-specific; qualitative responses from the survey give an indication that this must be a future consideration.",

    "abstract": "In this study the geometric parameter of the contact length is introduced, which intends to combine force exertion and perceived handle comfort in an anthropometric length in order to determine an optimal handle circumference. To prove suitability of the approach, 31 subjects were determined and correlations to handle circumferences with the highest finger forces and highest rated comfort were investigated. For all fingers, medium correlations were found among the contact lengths and the circumferences determined with maximum force (p < 0.001, rindex = 0.348, rmiddle = 0.419, rring = 0.374 and rlittle = 0.337) with high accordance of median values. Weak to moderate correlations were found between circumferences with maximum comfort and the contact lengths (p < 0.001, rindex = 0.150, rmiddle = 0.265, rring = 0.174). Using finger-specific proportionality factors, the contact lengths can be determined directly from the hand lengths, which enables great benefits for user-centered design.",

    "abstract": "As COVID-19 spread across Brazil, it quickly reached remote regions including Amazon's ultra-peripheral locations where patient transportation through rivers is added to the list of obstacles to overcome. This article analyses the pandemic's effects in the access of riverine communities to the prehospital emergency healthcare system in the Brazilian Upper Amazon River region. To do so, we present two studies that by using a Resilience Engineering approach aimed to predict the functioning of the Brazilian Mobile Emergency Medical Service (SAMU) for riverside and coastal areas during the COVID-19 pandemic, based on the normal system functioning. Study I, carried out before the pandemic, applied ethnographic methods for data collection and the Functional Resonance Analysis Method - FRAM for data analysis in order to develop a model of the mobile emergency care in the region during typical conditions of operation. Study II then estimated how changes in variability dynamics would alter system functioning during the pandemic, arriving at three trends that could lead the service to collapse. Finally, the accuracy of predictions is discussed after the pandemic first peaked in the region. Findings reveal that relatively small changes in variability dynamics can deliver strong implications to operating care and safety of expeditions aboard water ambulances. Also, important elements that add to the resilient capabilities of the system are extra-organizational, and thus during the pandemic safety became jeopardized as informal support networks grew fragile. Using FRAM for modelling regular operation enabled prospective scenario analysis that accurately predicted disruptions in providing emergency care to riverine population.",

    "abstract": "Regular standing interruptions to sedentary work are recommended, but their dosage is understudied. To measure perception variations associated with different sit:stand ratios, 16 people used six ratios (30:0, 27:3, 24:6, 21:9, 18:12 and 15:15) within 30-min cycles in their normal office environment. At start and end of each workday, study participants recorded their perception of 11 factors on a 10-point scale. Musculoskeletal discomfort in 10 body regions was measured before and after exposure to sit-stand ratios. Overall preferred ratios were recorded. Sit:stand ratio affected all perceived factors, with impact varying. Standing at least 6 min improved results most overall; however, individual perceived factors were least impacted by any of 30:0, 27:3, 24:6 or 21:9. Preferred sit:stand ratios were 15:15, 18:12 and 21:9. Typically, least liked ratios involved briefest standing (30:0, 27:3, 24:6) although two participants least liked 15:15. Understanding these variations contributes to appropriate standing dosage recommendations.",

    "abstract": "Neglecting a critical auditory alarm is a major obstacle to maintaining a safe environment, especially in aviation. Earlier studies have indicated that tasks with a higher perceptual or cognitive load in the visual modality influence the processing of auditory stimuli. It is unclear, however, whether other factors, such as memory failure, active neglect, or expectancy influence the effect of cognitive load on auditory alarm detection sensitivity during aeronautical decision-making. In this study, we investigated this issue in three laboratory experiments using the technique of signal detection analysis, in which participants were asked to make a landing decision based on indicators of the instrument landing system while also trying to detect an audible alarm. We found that the sensitivity of auditory alarm detection was reduced under conditions of high cognitive load and that this effect persisted even when the auditory detection response occurred first (before the landing decision response) and when the probability of an auditory alarm was 40%. However, the sensitivity of auditory detection was not influenced by cognitive load under high expectancy conditions (60% probability of alarm presentation). Furthermore, the value of the response bias was reduced under high cognitive load conditions when the probability of an auditory alarm was low (20%). With an increase in the level of expectancy (40% and 60% probability of alarm presentation), it was found that cognitive load did not influence the response bias. These findings indicate that visual cognitive load affects the sensitivity to an auditory alarm only at a low expectancy level (20% and 40% probability of alarm presentation). The effect of cognitive load on the sensitivity to an auditory alarm was not due to memory failure or active neglect and the response bias was more sensitive to the expectancy factor.",

    "doi": "10.1016/j.apergo.2021.103627",
    "abstract": "Now and in the coming years a new European Rail Traffic Management System (ERTMS) is being deployed on a larger scale. In the system level chosen in the Netherlands (Level 2) lineside signals will disappear and the train driver will receive all information needed for safe and efficient train operation through an interface inside the train cab. Furthermore, procedures, driving skills and communication will alter. Many train drivers will thus need to be trained in driving with ERTMS. Train operating companies (TOC) have to decide on efficient and effective strategies to organise this extensive training volume and to reassure that drivers become and remain proficient after training when roll-out of ERTMS may not have been fully completed. In this paper the central questions to be answered are: How many hours/duties does a driver have to do during a certain period of time on an ERTMS track section to become proficient with ERTMS (learning period), and to stay proficient (retaining period)? The approach taken is unique for rail industry (to the authors' knowledge) and is based on big data analyses. In this study, we were able to study the collective performance of train drivers, by big data analysis while at the same time maintaining privacy through pseudonymisation of the train driver database and their individual performances, characteristics and other potential privacy sensitive data. Databases containing detailed information on all planned and accomplished train service times/positions of the last three years (2015–2017) of a large TOC were combined with personal data from HR databases (age, experience, ERTMS training history, job assessment results, etcetera). From the data, delays caused by rolling stock and train operating related issues were identified. The amount and duration of these delays were correlated with the personal data to test research hypotheses. Again, at the same time we maintained privacy of the individuals’ personal data. Although the research has some limitations due to the small amount of existing ERTMS lines, and associated rolling stock, the results show some clear correlations. Thus, quantifiable directions to the minimum amount of ERTMS driving per 3 months during the first year and in the years after are presented. The results are now being translated into models for training and rostering related to the phase of ERTMS roll-out.",

Seventy-two healthy adults including 36 younger and 36 older adults participated in two experimental sessions, i.e., lower-limb joint proprioception assessment session and gait assessment session. Lower-limb joint proprioception was assessed by joint position sense errors measured at the ankle, knee and hip of the dominant side. Postural control during gait was characterized by step length, step width and local dynamic stability. Results showed that hip proprioception contributed the most to postural control during gait among the lower-limb joint proprioception components, and that mechanisms for the hip proprioception effects were different between age groups. These findings highlighted the importance of incorporating hip proprioception enhancement exercises in postural control training programs, and the necessity of considering age-related differences in the effects of hip proprioception when designing these exercises.",

    "abstract": "Falls on icy surfaces are among the top causes of injuries for workers exposed to the outdoor environment. Our recent field study showed that a new generation of winter footwear incorporating composite outsoles was able to reduce slips and falls on icy surfaces by 68% and 78%, respectively. The widespread adoption of this type of footwear may lead to substantial reductions in pain, suffering and costs of fall-related injuries. However, these composite materials are sensitive to wear and abrasion, which makes it likely that their slip-resistance performance may degrade with use. The goal of this pilot study was to determine the extent to which the slip-resistance of two types of winter footwear with composite outsoles changed as they wore down with real-world use. Seven participants were recruited for this study and were asked to walk 100K steps with their assigned footwear. Tread depth and slip–resistance performance (using the Maximum Achievable Angle test) were measured at baseline and again after each 25K-step interval up to 100K. Our results showed that the slip-resistance performance of the test footwear dropped significantly after the 75K and 100K step intervals compared to baseline. In addition, significant changes in tread depth were found after only 25K steps. These findings indicate that the performance of this type of footwear degrades relatively quickly with real-world use. Therefore, larger scale study of the slip-resistance of winter footwear with composite outsoles is needed and members of the public should be made aware of the potential loss of slip-resistance of these products.",

The purpose of this study was to compare the reduction in sagittal spine motion during manual lifting tasks following two training approaches: didactic (DID) and augmented feedback (AUG). Untrained participants (n = 26) completed lifting tests (box, medication bag, and paramedic backboard) and a randomly-assigned intervention involving 50 practice box lifts. Lifting tests were performed immediately before and after training, and one-week after interventions. Both groups exhibited reductions in spine motions immediately and one-week after the interventions. However, the AUG intervention group elicited significantly greater reductions in 5 of 12 between-group comparisons (3 tasks × 4 spine motion variables). The results of the current study support the use of augmented feedback-based approaches to manual handling training over education-based approaches.",

    "abstract": "Advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS) can enhance road safety by sending warning signals to drivers. Multimodal signals are gaining attention in ADAS warning design because they offer redundant information that facilitates human–system communication. However, no consensus has been reached on which multimodal design offers optimal benefit to road safety. Icons iconically map the real world and are associated with fast recognition and response time. Therefore, this study aims to investigate whether visual and auditory icons will benefit the effectiveness of audiovisual multimodal warnings. Thirty-two participants (16 females) experienced four types of unimodal warnings (high and low mapping visual warnings and high and low mapping auditory warnings) and four types of audiovisual warnings (high mapping visual + high mapping auditory warning, low mapping visual + low mapping auditory warning, high mapping visual + low mapping auditory warning, and low mapping visual + high mapping auditory warning) in simulated driving conditions. Visual warnings are presented in a head-up display. Results showed that multimodal warnings outperformed unimodal warnings (i.e., modality effect). We found mapping effect in audiovisual warnings, but only high mapping auditory constituents benefited warning effectiveness. Eye movement results revealed that the high mapping constituents might distract drivers from the road. This study adds evidence that multimodal warnings can offer extra benefits to drivers and high mapping auditory signals should be included in multimodal warning design to achieve better driving performance.",

    "abstract": "Searching for targets among distractors in visual scenes can be more difficult due to the presence of clutter. However, studies in various domains have shown differentiated effects according to the expertise of the searcher. The present study extended these findings to the domain of action video games expertise. 58 participants, split in 2 groups (action video game players and non-action video game players) searched for targets in visual scenes under two clutter conditions (uncluttered and high clutter). Reaction times and accuracy served as measures of performance, and the visual behavior was assessed using the number and duration of eye fixations. Our findings suggest that visual clutter has a negative influence on performance and alters the visual behavior during visual search in action video game scenes. Our results also suggest that expert action video game players might use different visual strategies to cope with clutter, leading however to no performance benefits.",

Participants included 20 circulating nurses (CNs) and 16 nurse anesthetists (NAs) who completed a total of 70 operations in which each operation required one CN and one NA. The experiment was separated into a control group (operating noise only) vs. an experimental group (3 different music types-between subjects and 2 music volume levels-within-subjects). Results showed that all participants had excellent situation awareness performance despite their mental workload showing significant differences in various phases of the surgery. Music at 55–60 dB caused lower mental workloads and anxiousness for nurses than those exposed to levels of 75–80 dB. When Mozart's music was played, the participants' mental workload and situation anxiety were lower than when exposed to other music types. Music played at 60 dB during an operation may be a feasible solution to mitigate the negative effects of extra noise and thus improve the nurses' performance.",

    "abstract": "Whole-body powered exoskeletons (WB-PEXOs) can be effective in reducing the physical demands of heavy occupational work, yet almost no empirical evidence exists on the effects of WB-PEXO use. This study assessed the effects of WB-PEXO use on back and leg muscle activities during lab-based simulations of load handling tasks. Six participants (4M, 2F) completed two such tasks (load carriage and stationary load transfer), both with and without a WB-PEXO, and with a range of load masses in each task. WB-PEXO use reduced median levels of muscle activity in the back (∼42–53% in thoracic and ∼24–43% in lumbar regions) and legs (∼41–63% in knee flexors and extensors), and mainly when handling loads beyond low-moderate levels (10–15 kg). Overall, using the WB-PEXO also reduced inter-individual variance (smaller SD) in muscle activities. Future work should examine diverse users, focus on finding effective matches between WB-PEXO use and specific tasks, and identify applications in varied work environments.",

    "abstract": "This study examined whether a repetitive light assembly task could be performed according to different movement sequences identified as ways of doing (WoD), and whether the age of the participants or the work pace affected the number of WoDs selected by each participant, or the kinematic parameters for each WoDs. For two work paces, 62 right-handed men in 3 age-groups were asked to fix a handle on a base with 2 nuts without discontinuity for a period of 20 min; no assembly procedure was demonstrated. The WoDs were characterized by a cross tabulation video coding method, and by measuring vertical force applied and the parameters of upper limb kinematics, as well as these measures’ approximate entropy (ApEN). Five main different WoDs were used. Although most participants varied their WoD, neither participant age nor work pace affected the number of WoD they used. However, the WoDs differed from each other by the sequence of movements and by the level of ApEn of their kinematic variables without interfering with the production rate. Allowing operators to vary their WoDs when performing repetitive tasks could reduce strain on the locomotor system.",

    "abstract": "Wearable inertial sensors may be used to objectively quantify exposure to some physical risk factors associated with musculoskeletal disorders. However, concerns regarding their potential negative effects on user safety and satisfaction remain. This study characterized the self-reported daily discomfort, distraction, and burden associated with wearing inertial sensors on the upper arms, trunk, and dominant wrist of 31 manufacturing workers collected over 15 full work shifts. Results indicated that the workers considered the devices as generally comfortable to wear, not distracting, and not burdensome to use. Exposure to non-neutral postures (discomfort, right arm, beta = 0.02; trunk, beta = −0.01), non-cyclic tasks (distraction, beta = -0.26), and higher body mass indices (discomfort, beta = 0.05; distraction, beta = 0.02) contributed to statistically significant (p < 0.05), albeit practically small increases in undesirable ratings. For instance, for each additional percentage of time working with the right arm elevated ≥60°, self-reported discomfort ratings increased 0.02 cm on a standard 10 cm visual analog scale. Female workers reported less discomfort and distraction while wearing the sensors at work than males (discomfort, beta = −0.93; distraction, beta = −0.3). In general, the low ratings of discomfort, distraction, and burden associated with wearing the devices during work suggests that inertial sensors may be suitable for extended use among manufacturing workers.",

The application of this technique was used to detect errors, clean and optimize EMG data in order characterize and compare shoulder muscular load in farmworkers during apple harvesting in a trellised orchard. Surface EMG was used to take measurements from twenty-four participants in an actual field work environment. Anomalies in the EMG data were detected and removed with a customized algorithm using principal component analysis, interquartile range cut-off and unsupervised cluster analysis. This study found significantly greater upper trapezius muscle activity in farmworkers who used a ladder as compared to the alternative platform-based method where a team of mobile platform workers harvested apples from the tree tops and a second separate team of ground workers harvested apples from the tree bottoms. By comparing the unprocessed and the processed, anomaly-free EMG data, the robustness of our proposed method was demonstrated.",

    "abstract": "Objectives To provide an overview of protocols assessing the effect of occupational exoskeletons on users and to formulate recommendations towards a literature-based assessment framework to benchmark the effect of occupational exoskeletons on the user. Methods PubMed (MEDLINE), Web of Science database and Scopus were searched (March 2, 2021). Studies were included if they investigated the effect of one or more occupational exoskeletons on the user. Results In total, 139 eligible studies were identified, encompassing 33, 25 and 18 unique back, shoulder and other exoskeletons, respectively. Device validation was most frequently conducted using controlled tasks while collecting muscle activity and biomechanical data. As the exoskeleton concept matures, tasks became more applied and the experimental design more representative. With that change towards realistic testing environments came a trade-off with experimental control, and user experience data became more valuable. Discussion This evidence mapping systematic review reveals that the assessment of occupational exoskeletons is a dynamic process, and provides literature-based assessment recommendations. The homogeneity and repeatability of future exoskeleton assessment experiments will increase following these recommendations. The current review recognises the value of variability in evaluation protocols in order to obtain an overall overview of the effect of exoskeletons on the users, but the presented framework strives to facilitate benchmarking the effect of occupational exoskeletons on the users across this variety of assessment protocols.",

    "abstract": "A key to the development of more effective interventions to promote movement and reduce physical inactivity in office workplaces may be to measure and locate individual's spatial movement. Using an activity space estimation method, high resolution location data collected from 15 office workers over 12 days were used to estimate and analyse the location and extent of their daily spatial movement whilst in an office work-based setting. The results indicated that the method, kernel density estimation, combined with location data offers significant opportunities to not only measure and compare spatial movement behaviours but also simultaneously identify the locations where the behaviours occur. Combined with other data streams, this method will allow researchers to further investigate the influence of different environmental characteristics on these behaviours, potentially leading the development of more effective, longer lasting interventions to promote movement and reduce stationary behaviour, ultimately improving the health of office workers.",

    "doi": "10.1016/j.apergo.2021.103608",
    "abstract": "Background Failure to rescue (FTR) denotes mortality from post-operative complications after surgery with curative intent. High-volume, low-mortality units have similar complication rates to others, but have lower FTR rates. Effective response to the deteriorating post-operative patient is therefore critical to reducing surgical mortality. Resilience Engineering might afford a useful perspective for studying how the management of deterioration usually succeeds and how resilience can be strengthened. Methods We studied the response to the deteriorating patient following emergency abdominal surgery in a large surgical emergency unit, using the Functional Resonance Analysis Method (FRAM). FRAM focuses on the conflicts and trade-offs inherent in the process of response, and how staff adapt to them, rather than on identifying and eliminating error. 31 semi-structured interviews and two workshops were used to construct a model of the response system from which conclusions could be drawn about possible ways to strengthen system resilience. Results The model identified 23 functions, grouped into five clusters, and their respective variability. The FRAM analysis highlighted trade-offs and conflicts which affected decisions over timing, as well as strategies used by staff to cope with these underlying tensions. Suggestions for improving system resilience centred on improving team communication, organisational learning and relationships, rather than identifying and fixing specific system faults.

    "abstract": "A ‘compressed’ shift schedule (substitution of a rest day by a shift, shortening the duration of work breaks) was introduced for a better fit with aircraft traffic load. Thereafter, the company asked for a survey assessing the effects of the compressed shift system. Air traffic controllers (ATCOs) completed retrospectively a specific questionnaire assessing the effects of shift schedule (modified vs. initial) and of traffic load on fatigue, alertness (on-shift, upon awakening, during daily non-work activities), and sleep (duration, satisfaction). Work organization had marginal and unexpected effects, which might indicate ATCOs' disapproval of the intervention. Traffic load affected sleep satisfaction and alertness during work and non-work activities. Specific effects of shift included reduced sleep time prior to morning shifts compared to night shifts, whereas alertness and fatigue were rated at comparable levels for both shifts. Results suggest that shiftwork features which favor sleep loss across a work cycle have deleterious consequences on alertness and increase the need for recovery, which are further enhanced by traffic load.",

We studied care transitions from the operating room (OR) to pediatric and adult intensive critical care units (ICU) using Systems Engineering Initiative for Patient Safety (SEIPS)-based process modeling. We interviewed twenty-nine physicians (surgery, anesthesia, pediatric critical care) and nurses (OR, ICU) and administered the AHRQ Hospital Survey on Patient Safety Culture items about handoffs, care transitions and teamwork. Care transitions are complex, spatio-temporal processes and involve work during the transition (i.e., handoff and transport) and preparation and follow up activities (i.e., articulation work). Physicians defined the transition as starting earlier and ending later than nurses. Clinicians in the OR to adult ICU transition without a team handoff reported significantly less information loss and better cooperation, despite positive interview data. A team handoff and supporting articulation work should increase awareness, improving quality and safety of care transitions.",

To determine this influence on test benches, the state of research suggests a cylindrical measuring handle. Since this shape is not suitable for all power tool handles, we develop a design for a knob-shaped measuring handle. The grip force applied to an orbital sander was measured in a test person study. The recorded data was combined with a 3D scan and evaluated by an algorithm which determined the separation plane of the measuring handle to integrate the force sensors. This plane is perpendicular to the vector of the subjects’ grip forces. Furthermore, it divides the knob-shaped handle of the sander primarily vertically. The determination of the separation plane enables the design of a knob-shaped measuring handle for grip force measurement to analyze the hand-arm impedance of an overlying hand position.",

We conducted a two-stage exploratory Delphi-study with 30 international experts. It was found that the overall environment, stool-urine collection device, garbage collection interface and negative pressure package interface of the hygiene area most affected astronauts’ experience. Remarkably, experts have highest visual requirements for the cleanliness of the overall environment and for stool and urine collection devices in the hygiene area. These tend to have low saturation and low blackness colours, while the garbage collection interface and negative pressure package interface have conspicuity and discernibility visual requirements. It was found that experts tend to choose high saturation and high brightness colours.",

    "abstract": "A large component of Neville Stanton's work has focused on situation awareness in domains such as defence, transport, and process control. A significant contribution has been to initiate a shift from considering individual human operator situation awareness to considering the situation awareness of human and non-human teams, organisations, and even sociotechnical systems. Though controversial when introduced, the distributed situation awareness model has become increasingly relevant for modern day systems and problems. In this article we reflect on Stanton's contribution and point to a pressing need to consider a. The situation awareness of advanced technologies, and b. situation awareness at a sociotechnical system, societal and even global level. This is demonstrated via discussion on two contemporaneous issues: automated vehicles and the COVID-19 pandemic. It is concluded that, given advances such as artificial intelligence, the increased connectedness of society, emerging issues such as disinformation, and an increasing set of global threats, Stanton's distributed situation awareness model and associated analysis framework provide a useful toolkit for future Human Factors and Ergonomics applications.",

    "abstract": "Objective To investigate the effects of repeated work bouts in the heat on peak body core temperature and to explore sex-based differences in body core temperature responses. Methods Fourteen males and fifteen females performed four work bouts (two heavy and two moderate, alternating) in 32.5 °C Wet Bulb Globe Temperature (WBGT), each separated by 30-min seated rest in 28.0 °C WBGT. Participants wore a military combat uniform with body armour and helmet (10 kg load) during the work bouts, removing the vest and helmet during recovery periods. Results Body core temperature elevation over time was faster in the first compared with subsequent work bouts of each intensity. Body core temperature elevation was similar between males and females during the first heavy work bout, then remained significantly lower in females for the reminder of the trial. Conclusions Contrary to the assumed progressive elevation in strain, but in agreement with recent literature, a gradual reduction in heat storage in subsequent exercise bouts prevented a cumulative increase in heat strain in the conditions tested.",

    "abstract": "Data-linked Next Generation Weather Radar (NEXRAD) images can be delayed up to 20 min in the cockpit. Pilots' underappreciating or ignoring the time delay may be the major cause of two fatal accidents. No studies have connected spatial awareness with accidents. This study evaluated how delayed radar information affects the spatial awareness of pilots at three levels of analysis. Thirty-one student pilots and flight instructors completed three sequential estimation tasks (i.e., the current location of storms, the current relative distance to storms, and the future relative distance to storms). Fifty-four weather scenarios were developed for three factors (storm speeds, delays, displays) and presented to pilots. The results indicated that delays and the storm speed significantly affected the three levels of spatial awareness. Participants' estimation accuracy was the lowest under long delay and fast speed in the current location estimation, under medium delay and speed in the current distance estimation, and under short delay and slow speed in the future distance estimation. Spatial awareness could be high under the long delay and fast speed conditions if pilots had no time limits. Thus, pilots can process 20-min delayed radar information. However, there were no differences in estimation accuracy between the static and animation displays in any of the conditions. Well-designed features on displays, such as scale or distance measuring tools, can aid pilots’ spatial estimation and support all levels of spatial awareness.",

High support chairs enable people experiencing loss of mobility to be mobile, but current chair designs are associated with global functional loss and pressure ulcers.

Significant reduction in joint angles for the person pushing the chair (degree difference range −3.6 to 14.2) and decreased seated pressure (w/kg difference range −0.2 to 2.1) for the seated user were identified for the motorised chair. Longitudinal investigations are required to determine if the significant differences identified in this pilot study result in less manual handling injuries and pressure areas.",

    "doi": "10.1016/j.apergo.2021.103590",
    "abstract": "Histopathologists make diagnostic decisions that are thought to be based on pattern recognition, likely informed by cue-based associations formed in memory, a process known as cue utilisation. Typically, the cases presented to the histopathologist have already been classified as ‘abnormal’ by clinical examination and/or other diagnostic tests. This results in a high disease prevalence, the potential for ‘abnormality priming’, and a response bias leading to false positives on normal cases. This study investigated whether higher cue utilisation is associated with a reduction in positive response bias in the diagnostic decisions of histopathologists. Data were collected from eighty-two histopathologists who completed a series of demographic and experience-related questions and the histopathology edition of the Expert Intensive Skills Evaluation 2.0 (EXPERTise 2.0) to establish behavioural indicators of context-related cue utilisation. They also completed a separate, diagnostic task comprising breast histopathology images where the frequency of abnormality was manipulated to create a high disease prevalence context for diagnostic decisions relating to normal tissue. Participants were assigned to higher or lower cue utilisation groups based on their performance on EXPERTise 2.0. When the effects of experience were controlled, higher cue utilisation was specifically associated with a greater accuracy classifying normal images, recording a lower positive response bias. This study suggests that cue utilisation may play a protective role against response biases in histopathology settings.",

    "abstract": "Although smart infusion pumps were built to eliminate medication errors, new types of usability errors have arisen. The purposes of this study were to determine potential risks when using smart pumps during secondary medication administration and to identify opportunities for design improvements. We observed and analyzed nurses when they interacted with smart pumps and heuristically evaluated the smart pump to identify usability problems. Forty-three usability problems were identified with the smart pump. The usability problems have the potential to create high cognitive burden on nurses and to increase the likelihood of mistakes. We discuss design and process improvement recommendations for each major finding from this study.",

    "abstract": "A systematic review according to the PRISMA reporting standard was performed to identify causes of use errors in mechanical ventilators described in the literature. The PubMed search resulted in the inclusion of 16 papers. The errors described were systematically analyzed with regard to their causes and categorized in an adapted cause-and-effect diagram. The causes of use errors were related to specific usability issues and to the general condition that medical staff often work with different ventilators. When many devices are used, the different user interfaces are a source of use errors, since, for example, the same ventilation modes have different names. In order to avoid the identified causes for use errors in the future, this work offers manufacturers of ventilation devices design recommendations and the possibility to include the results in their risk management. In addition, standardizing user interface content across all ventilators, as in ISO 19223, can help reduce use errors.",

    "abstract": "Auditory comfort evaluations are garnering increased attention in engineering and particularly in the context of air transportation. Being able to produce sound environments corresponding to various flight conditions in aircraft mock-ups would be a valuable tool to investigate acoustic comfort inside aircrafts in controlled environments. Before using such mock-ups, they must be developed and validated in physical and perceptual terms. This paper provides a perceptual validation of sound environment reproduction inside aircraft mock-up. To provide a faithfully reproduced sound environment, time, frequency and spatial characteristics should be preserved. Physical sound field reproduction approaches for spatial sound reproduction are required while properly preserving localization cues at the listener's ears to recreate a realistic and immersing sound environment. We report a perceptual validation of a sound field reproduction system developed in an aircraft mock-up based on multichannel least-square methods and equalization. Twenty participants evaluated reproduced sound environments relative to a reference sound environment in an aircraft cabin mock-up equipped with a 41-actuator multichannel sound reproduction system. Results indicate that the preferred reproduction corresponds to the best physical reconstruction of the sound environment.",

    "doi": "10.1016/j.apergo.2021.103577",
    "abstract": "Bus controllers are an essential part of the London bus network. Although the bus driver is the individual directly in control of the vehicle, inputs from both the controller and driver influence operations. Currently, little research has focused on the dynamic between these parties, and how it works in the day-to-day operation of a bus. In the current study, data was collected across focus groups with controllers to understand the controller-driver relationship from the controller perspective. The objectives of the research were to: investigate interactions and working relationships between bus controllers and drivers in London and to explore the effect of controller/driver relationships on workload, stress and fatigue. It is clear that the working relationship between controllers and drivers is a challenging one, with both parties often misunderstanding the role of the other. This is made worse by the nature of communication via radio including poor quality audio leading to difficult interactions. All of the participating controllers expressed being overloaded with work, leading to feelings of stress and fatigue, with shift work and irregular hours being discussed as a cause of controller fatigue. Any steps taken to improve the difficult working relationship between drivers and controllers can be seen as beneficial because they could improve efficiency, worker wellbeing, and possibly safety.",

    "year": "2022",
    "doi": "10.1016/j.apergo.2021.103588",
    "abstract": "Through a randomized controlled trial, we evaluated the effects of an electro-magnetic active seat suspension that reduces exposure of a long-haul truck driver to whole body vibration (WBV) on low back pain (LBP) and disability. Among 276 drivers recruited from six trucking terminals of a major US trucking company, 135 eligible drivers were assigned to either having an Active Seat (Intervention: n = 70) – the BoseRide® electro-magnetic active seat – or Passive Seat (reference: n = 65) – a new version of their current seat (passive air suspension seat) – installed in their truck via block (terminal) randomization. Low back pain (LBP) severity, on a 0–10 scale and the Oswestry LBP Disability Index were collected before and 3-, 6-, 12-, 18-, and 24-months post seat installation. LBP severity and LBP disability scores were significantly lower post seat installation in both groups. At 3 months, LBP severity decreased -1.4 [95% CI: -2.1 to -0.7: n = 46] for drivers in the Active Seat arm, and −1.5 [95% CI: -2.3 to -0.8: n = 41] for drivers in the Passive Seat arm. In a subset of drivers, WBV exposures were collected before and after the seat installation. WBV exposures significantly decreased post seat installation for Active Seat (p < 0.01) but not for Passive Seat (p = 0.15). While the new seat-suspension technology reduced WBV exposures, LBP appeared to be improved by multiple factors. These results were limited by the secondary prevention approach and the longer-term loss to follow up due to large rates of driver turnover typical for the industry.",

Participants (n = 270) from >200 organisations across 19 industry sectors completed an online survey. Seven interviews were conducted in a sub-sample of participants from organisations without SSWs. The majority (80%) of workplaces reported having invested in SSWs. Workplaces without SSWs, opposed to those with SSWs, were more likely to be private (79.6% vs. 43.5%), of small/medium size (70.4% vs. 35.6%) and without a wellness program (57.4% vs. 22.2%) (all p < 0.05). Financial implications were the main reason for not investing in SSWs. Exercise and stretch breaks were alternative initiatives to reducing sedentary behaviour at work. Better evidence on the return on investment is needed to support purchasing decisions on SSWs.",

    "abstract": "Aviation places significant demands on pilots' perceptual and attentional capacities. The avoidance of other objects both on the ground and in the air is critical to safe flight. Research on automobile driving has revealed the occurrence of ‘inattentional blindness’ (IB) whereby objects clearly located within the visual field may not detected when drivers are concurrently engaged in another attention capturing task such as a cellphone conversation. Almost no comparable research has been conducted within the aviation domain despite the significance of both ground-based and mid-air collisions. The present study was designed to investigate the effects of diverting attentional resources away from the primary task of safely flying a simulated light aircraft from takeoff to cruising. Flight naïve students were trained to proficiency in a flight-simulator and flew two simulated flights with and without a competing attentional task. Detection of a variety of objects placed in the background was measured. The results showed that when distracted by an engaging cellphone conversation novice pilots failed to detect many of the objects located within the visual scene. Recognition accuracy was greater when pilots' attention was not diverted elsewhere. There was a reduction in time spent looking at some key flight instruments but not on others. Inattentional blindness poses significant flight safety risks and further research into both the stimulus and perceiver characteristics that promote or reduce inattentional blindness would be of significant benefit to aviation safety.",

    "abstract": "Workplace temperature screening has become standard practice during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. The objective was to determine the consistency of four temperature devices during exposure to simulated and actual environmental conditions reflective of a workplace. An infrared (IR) digital thermometer (accuracy(A)±0.2), IR laser thermometer (A±1), and thermal imaging camera (A±0.3) were used to measure forehead and tympanic (digital only) temperatures. The first experiment was conducted in a controlled simulated environment (−20 to 20 °C) with three participants (32-YOF, 27-YOM, 20-YOF). The second experiment used actual outdoor conditions (−0.48 to 45.6 °C) with two participants (32-YOF, 27-YOM). The tympanic measurement was the least impacted by environmental temperature (mean(±SD)): simulated (36.8(±0.18) °C) and actual (36.9(±0.16) °C). The thermal imaging camera had the lowest RMSE values (0.81–0.97 °C), with outdoor temperatures ranging from 0 to 45 °C. Environmental temperature influenced forehead temperature readings and required a resting period in a thermoneutral environment (5–9 min (−20 to −10 °C) to immediate (15–20 °C)).",

Cloth masks have been recommended because of their effectiveness, availability, and reusability. Like other types of face masks, however, user discomfort while wearing cloth masks is thought to engender behaviors that limit the effectiveness of cloth masks as source control (e.g., adjusting or removing one's mask temporarily while in public). To design cloth masks that are more tolerable, a measurement instrument for assessing subjective user discomfort is needed. Across two studies, we identified and confirmed a two-dimensional factor structure underlying the discomfort of cloth masks – discomfort related to the breathability and discomfort related to the tightness of the mask against the face and head. Additionally, we provide replicable evidence that both factor-subscales predict the self-reported frequencies of problematic mask-wearing behaviors.",

    "abstract": "Research into road safety has evolved from individual level component analysis to a much broader, systemic approach that acknowledges the fusion of ‘socio’ and ‘technical’ system elements. Over the past four decades, Professor Neville Stanton has contributed to over 179 journal articles, book chapters and conference papers in the field of road safety. The journey from ‘thinking humans’ to ‘systems thinking’ is demonstrated in this paper through the novel application of the Risk Management Framework (RMF) to the categorisation of research activities. A systematic review of Neville's contributions to the field of road safety demonstrates that over the years, his research activities have evolved from investigating single technological or human performance aspects in isolation (e.g., in-vehicle information design and workload) through to the holistic analysis of much broader systems (e.g., investigating road safety as a whole). Importantly, this evolution goes hand in hand with a change in the focus and emphasis of recommendations for improvements to safety. Going forward, Neville has helped pave the way for fundamental changes and improvements to be made to road safety systems around the world.",

    "abstract": "The aim of this research was to examine how broadband noise which is present in many workplaces affects dynamic decision-making. The effect of potential moderating factors, cognitive workload and sex, were also examined. Forty-eight participants (24 females) with an average age of 27.38 years (SD = 12.34) were asked to complete a dynamic decision-making task over three consecutive-days. Independent variables were Noise (Broadband - 0dBA vs. 75dBA above background) and Cognitive Workload (Low vs. High, manipulated via presence of a secondary task). Among females, broadband noise significantly impaired performance in low workload, but significantly improved performance in high workload. In contrast, among males broadband noise had no significant effect on overall performance. From an applied perspective, understanding the interaction between noise, cognitive workload and sex allows for the design of a training environment to ensure maximum performance by all staff.",

    "doi": "10.1016/j.apergo.2022.103884",
    "abstract": "Background Hospitalists are physicians trained in internal medicine and play a critical role in delivering care in in-patient settings. They work across and interact with a variety of sub-systems of the hospital, collaborate with various specialties, and spend their time exclusively in hospitals. Research shows that hospitalists report burnout rates above the national average for physicians and thus, it is important to understand the key factors contributing to hospitalists' burnout and identify key priorities for improving hospitalists’ workplace. Methods Hospitalists at an academic medical center and a community hospital were recruited to complete a survey that included demographics, rating the extent to which socio-technical (S-T) factors contributed to burnout, and 22-item Maslach Burnout Inventory – Human Services Survey (MBI-HSS). Twelve contextual inquiries (CIs) involving shadowing hospitalists for ∼60 h were conducted varied by shift type, length of tenure, age, sex, and location. Using data from the survey and CIs, an affinity diagram was developed and presented during focus groups to 12 hospitalists to validate the model and prioritize improvement efforts. Results The overall survey participation rate was 68%. 76% of hospitalists reported elevated levels on at least one sub-component within the MBI. During CIs, key breakdowns were reported in relationships, communication, coordination of care, work processes in electronic healthcare records (EHR), and physical space. Using data from CIs, an affinity diagram was developed. Hospitalists voted the following as key priorities for targeted improvement: improve relationships with other care team members, improve communication systems and prevent interruptions and disruptions, facilitate coordination of care, improve workflows in EHR, and improve physical space. Conclusions This mixed-method study utilizes participatory and data-driven approaches to provide evidence-based prioritization of key factors contributing to hospitalists’ burnout. Healthcare systems may utilize this approach to identify workplace factors contributing to provider burnout and consider targeting the factors identified by providers to best optimize scarce resources.",

    "abstract": "Despite growing literature, limited research details the influence of passive upper limb exoskeletons on upper limb kinematics. Two bolting tasks and a tracing task were completed at two heights (overhead and between waist and overhead height) for four exoskeleton conditions (no exoskeleton, and 3 levels of exoskeleton assistance) by female participants. Motion capture data, ratings of perceived exertion and discomfort, and task duration were recorded. Exoskeleton condition increased minimum shoulder elevation by 35–36% (Δ10.5–10.7°) at 1.81 kg and 2.72 kg of support, mean shoulder external rotation by 316% (Δ24.6°) at 0.91 kg of support and mean forearm pronation by 30.9% (Δ14.6°) at 0.91 kg of support. Exoskeleton condition reduced ratings of perceived exertion and discomfort, but not significantly. Task duration was unaffected. Exoskeleton use at any of three different settings modestly affected some joint kinematics for the tasks examined, which may merit consideration when deciding on occupational exoskeleton implementation.",

    "abstract": "This work is directed to an understanding as to how the knowledge of, and the application of human factors and ergonomics (HF/E) can save lives. To achieve this, the paper features an assessment of the achievements of one particular scientist, Neville Anthony Stanton, and how his body of contributions has impacted the realm of ground transportation and, in particular, driver behavior assessment. On the widest scale, it is objectively and obviously the case that Stanton is one of the most fecund scientists of our discipline ever. His impact is evident globally and results not simply from the sum total of his written and published works but through an extensive record of international scientific presentations, mutual investigative collaborations across the globe, and mentoring at all levels of the Academy and beyond. As well as mastering and elucidating the HF/E dimensions of a number of content domains, he has generated vital, and even unique tools and methods through which we can explore and understand the problem space of HF/E. Placing those attainments in context permits us a wider window upon how the discipline itself exerts practical and positive influences across the wide swath of real-world systems.",

    "abstract": "To determine the applications of machine learning (ML) techniques used for the primary prevention of work-related musculoskeletal disorders (WMSDs), a scoping review was conducted using seven literature databases. Of the 4,639 initial results, 130 primary research studies were deemed relevant for inclusion. Studies were reviewed and classified as a contribution to one of six steps within the primary WMSD prevention research framework by van der Beek et al. (2017). ML techniques provided the greatest contributions to the development of interventions (48 studies), followed by risk factor identification (33 studies), underlying mechanisms (29 studies), incidence of WMSDs (14 studies), evaluation of interventions (6 studies), and implementation of effective interventions (0 studies). Nearly a quarter (23.8%) of all included studies were published in 2020. These findings provide insight into the breadth of ML techniques used for primary WMSD prevention and can help identify areas for future research and development.",

    "abstract": "This study assessed the influence of different types of flooring on infants' crawling motion patterns and performance. Each participating infant (range: 8.7-12.4 months) was encouraged to crawl on a tatami mat made of woven straw as well as other flooring types such as hardwood, carpet, and joint mat. Material tests were conducted to quantify the friction and shock absorption of the flooring. A three-dimensional motion capture system was used to measure spatiotemporal and kinematic variables during hands-and-knees crawling. An increased crawling rate was associated with a faster cadence of cyclic arm movements, but not with crawling stride length. Hardwood flooring had a significantly lower crawling rate and longer duration of hand-floor contact than tatami, while the crawling stride length and range of motion of joint movements were hardly affected by flooring type. The results of this study suggest a drawback of hardwood flooring in terms of infants’ effective quadrupedal locomotion.",

Hand harvesters are used, avoiding damage to the fruit and increasing harvesting efficiency multifold when compared with that of hand-picking. The downside of these hand harvesters is their high Hand Arm Vibration (HAV), which is very dangerous for the worker and can cause hand-arm vibration syndrome (HAVS). The aim of this study is to propose a spring-based anti-vibration handle that can be attached to vibrating equipment (blueberry hand harvester). Four different parameters were measured for the developed spring-based handles: hand arm vibration, wrist posture, muscle activity, and subjective discomfort rating. Results have shown that the use of a spring-based handle can reduce HAV by 61.1%, which is within the exposure limit values (ELV) defined by the European Union.",

    "abstract": "In this paper, we discuss the ways in which Neville Stanton has challenged himself, his research colleagues, PhD students, the many co-authors and contributors to his publications, and the entire Ergonomics community to determine what it means for there to be ‘consistent standards for how [Ergonomics] methods are described and reported.’ Only in this way, can it be possible to make claims about whether or not a method in Ergonomics is effective. Given that he is Chartered as both an Occupational Psychologist and an Ergonomist, it is not surprising that he has been concerned with the question of the reliability and validity of Ergonomics methods. In Occupational Psychology, psychometric and personnel selection methods are expected to exhibit acceptable levels of reliability, but this is an expectation which is still somewhat alien to Ergonomics. Neville's work has been instrumental in raising this issue and in providing approaches which can be used to critically evaluate the methods we use. We think that, despite his ground-breaking work, there is still much to do in the Ergonomics community to create the situation for which he has long argued.",

    "journal": "Applied Ergonomics",
    "year": "2022",
    "doi": "10.1016/j.apergo.2021.103580",
    "abstract": "With the rapid rise in unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) for military and civil first-person applications like infrastructure inspection, there is an increased need for skilled UAV operators. However, research on effective training of UAV pilots has not kept pace with the demand. How much autonomy should be onboard, how much training, and how much control humans should have are still points of debate. To help fill this gap, this paper examines how different training programs and levels of control autonomy affect training outcomes for people operating a UAV in inspection tasks with high onboard autonomy. Results revealed a cost-benefit trade space in that those top performers with both lower-level teleoperation and higher-level supervisory control training could achieve the best performance, but with higher variability, as compare to those who received just supervisory control training. Another important finding was that those trainees who were overconfident were more likely to spend too much time micro-controlling the UAV, and also 15 times more likely to crash. Given that commercial UAV licensing is expected to significantly increase in the next few years, these results suggest more work is needed to determine how to mitigate overconfidence bias both through training and design.",

We aimed to demonstrate the importance of testing the internal consistency and construct validity of the PSQI and of the Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS) by presenting the methodology in a sample of long-haul truckers in South Africa. Internal consistency of the questionnaires was assessed by Cronbach's alpha (defined as raw alpha≥0.70), and construct validity by factor analysis. 302 participants (49.3%) reported at least one night shift/week. Overall, the PSQI and ESS's alpha were 0.42 and 0.85, respectively. The factors explained 19.6% of 57.0% of the variance. The PSQI's alpha was 0.46 in night shift workers and 0.38 in non-night shift workers. In this occupational group, the PSQI must be used with caution. Testing the internal consistency and construct validity among the assessed population seems necessary. Sleep questionnaires adapted to shift workers should be preferred.",

The PRISMA methodology was applied and authors searched two databases (PubMed and Web of Science) for studies meeting the following inclusion criteria: (a) were conducted in a healthcare setting, (b) explored systems-factors leading to deviations in care processes, (c) were prospective and observational, (d) classified observations, and (e) were original research studies published in peer-reviewed journals. Thirty studies were analyzed and a variety of methods were identified for observer training, data collection and observation classification. Although primarily applied in surgery, comparable research has been successfully conducted in other venues such as trauma care, and delivery rooms. The findings of this review were synthesized into a framework of considerations for conducting rigorous methodological studies aimed at understanding clinical systems.",

    "abstract": "The high prevalence of work-related musculoskeletal disorders (WRMSDs) has been a concern in the meat-processing industry, owing to the manual nature of the work and the high upper-limb and neck exposure to movements that can lead to WRMSD. The ability to perform an accurate and fast assessment of WRMSDs remains a challenge in industrial environments. Most assessment methodologies rely on standard survey-based methods, which are time- and labor-intensive. In this paper, we present an application of inertial measurement units (IMUs) to measure human activity, and the use of artificial intelligence and machine learning techniques to perform task classification and ergonomic assessments in workplace settings. We present the results obtained by using simple low-cost IMUs worn on slaughterhouse worker wrists to capture information on their movements. We describe the use of this information to detect the risk factors of the wrists/hands that can lead to WRMSDs. The results indicate that by using low-cost IMU-based sensors on the wrists of slaughterhouse workers, we can accurately classify the sharpness of the knife and predict the worker RULA score.",

    "abstract": "Head Mounted Display (HMD) based Augmented Reality (AR) is being increasingly used in manufacturing and maintenance. However, limited research has been done to understand user interaction with AR interfaces, which may lead to poor usability, risk of occupational hazards, and low acceptance of AR systems. This paper uses a theoretically-driven approach to interaction design to investigate the impact of different AR modalities in terms of information mode (i.e. video vs. 3D animation) and interaction modality (i.e. hand-gesture vs. voice command) on user performance, workload, eye gaze behaviours, and usability during a maintenance assembly task. The results show that different information modes have distinct impacts compared to paper-based maintenance, in particular, 3D animation led to a 14% improvement over the video instructions in task completion time. Moreover, insights from eye gaze behaviours such as number of fixations and transition between Areas of Interest (AOIs) revealed the differences in attention switching and task comprehension difficulty with the choice of AR modalities. While, subjective user perceptions highlight some ergonomic issues such as misguidance and overreliance, which must be considered and addressed from the joint cognitive systems’ (JCSs) perspective and in line with the predictions derived from the Multiple Resources Model.",

In this 1980's television series the fictional Knight Industries Two Thousand (KITT) was a supercomputer on wheels with 1000 megabytes of memory. The protagonist was Michael Knight, a young loner on a crusade to champion the cause of the innocent and the helpless. This was a shadowy flight into the trials and tribulations of different levels of automation, re-claiming control when automation failed, and a wilful, chatty computer co-driver. An amusing metaphor, perhaps, for the research impact made by Neville Stanton in the field of vehicle automation. Without question – to paraphrase the Knight Rider outro – “one man can make a difference”. This festschrift in Neville's honour tells the story of how.",

    "abstract": "Organizational Design and Management (ODAM) elements of Ergonomics and Human Factors (E/HF) apply to congress organization. Exemplary delegate and organizer E/HF experience is constrained by shifting requirements, time pressures and financial constraints. E/HF application while organizing the International Ergonomics Association's Triennial Congress in 2021 (IEA2021) is described focusing on delivery platforms considering typical and exceptional (pandemic) constraints, emphasizing ODAM E/HF principles and generalizable lessons. Post-Congress feedback from delegates, session chairs and Congress organizers reveal the Congress as experienced. Presenting virtually allowed on-demand recording access following live sessions and increased question-and-answer flexibility. Frustrations included navigating multiple platforms and insufficient communications. Stakeholders’ differing expectations increased organizer workloads and delegate frustration. Maximum virtual presentation benefits require efforts to ensure integrated, human-centered platform development. Simply digitizing traditional Congress sessions ignores potential enhancements. Embracing innovations would help meet delegate communication needs via careful selection and deployment of evolving virtual meeting technologies. Organizational learning strategies can support these efforts.",

To achieve these goals across users, individual variation in muscle activation patterns when using an exoskeleton need to be evaluated. This study examined individual muscle activation patterns during walking with a powered ankle exoskeleton. 60% of the participants were observed to reduce medial gastrocnemius activation with exoskeleton powered and increase with the exoskeleton unpowered during stance. 80% of the participants showed a significant increase in tibialis anterior activation upon power addition, with inconsistent changes upon power removal during swing. 60% of the participants that were able to adapt to the system, did not de-adapt after 5 min. Muscle activity patterns differ between individuals in response to the exoskeleton power state, and affected the antagonist muscle behavior during this early adaptation. It is important to understand these different individual behaviors to inform the design of exoskeleton controllers and training protocols.",

    "doi": "10.1016/j.apergo.2021.103602",
    "abstract": "Most female soldiers report that in-service body armour systems are too large. We investigated whether a smaller prototype body armour system could improve thoracolumbar range of motion (ROM) and reduce interference when female soldiers performed dynamic postures. 97 female soldiers completed three ROM tasks and seven dynamic postures wearing no armour, an in-service body armour system, and a smaller prototype system. Feedback on comfort of the prototype system was also obtained. Thoracolumbar ROM and dynamic posture completion were both hindered by using body armour, although the participants’ performances were significantly less impeded when they wore the smaller prototype system compared to the in-service system. A smaller body armour system that is better matched to the anthropometric dimensions of female soldiers appears to improve overall fit and function. An increased range of body armour sizes and female-specific designs should be systematically explored to further enhance fit and function of body armour.",

    "abstract": "Prior research has found that office workers may not be fully utilizing their chair's back support. This may be due in part to cognitive demands or other psychological stressors. Not using the back support may increase the muscle tension and contribute to muscle fatigue and discomfort. Historically, footrests have been advocated to address anthropometric disparities in office settings. In this laboratory study, it was hypothesized that a footrest may facilitate the use of the backrest and mediate the biomechanical demands on the back and neck muscles, especially when cognitive workload is elevated. Twenty participants performed computer tasks, which varied in their complexity levels, both with and without an angled footrest. Using a footrest increased workers' use of a chair's backrest, increased pelvic rotation towards the backrest, and had a corresponding change in spine flexion. However, no changes were found in the sampled electromyographic activities due to the footrest.",

    "abstract": "Many anti-vibration gloves are available in the market but there are lacks of understanding of their effectiveness in facilitating various hand movements. This study addresses the knowledge gap through a wear trial with five types of anti-vibration gloves made of chloroprene rubber and spacer fabric. Surface electromyography of three forearm muscles of 16 male subjects was conducted during gripping, key pinching, woodblock transporting, screw inserting and screw driving tasks. The correlation between the compression properties of the gloves and hand performance was also evaluated. The results show that hand dexterity is inhibited and more muscle activity is needed to carry the woodblocks with the spacer fabric glove without special design features. A thicker glove can reduce the demand of the flexor digitorum superficialis muscle when using an impact driver. A thinner dorsal side and tailored padding can enhance hand dexterity. The findings can be used as a reference for designing anti-vibration gloves.",

    "abstract": "It is not just a rail driver but a “system” that drives a train and network controllers apply non-technical skills to facilitate their role as part of a team. However, because of siloed and distributed working, scenarios exist where network controllers may inadvertently increase operational safety risks. The aim of this study was to generate a better understanding of non-technical skill application in network controllers by identifying which skills and behaviours were associated with problematic ways of working, and which abilities were used to address error-producing scenarios, and thereby reduce risk. Use of a scenario technique and behavioural markers analysis of 61 scenarios generated from 55 network controllers in 8 organisations across Australia and New Zealand revealed a large and diverse application of non-technical skills. Careful consideration must be given to the way in which deficiencies in abilities and skills are addressed. Future research directions are given.",

    "abstract": "Purpose Although firefighters are required to perform various high-intensity critically essential tasks, the influence of neuromuscular function on firefighter occupational performance is unclear. The primary aim of the current study was to identify the key neuromuscular determinants of stair climb (SC) performance in firefighters. Methods Leg extension isometric peak torque (PT), peak power (PP), torque steadiness at 10% (Steadiness10%) and 50% (Steadiness50%) of PT, fatigability following 30 repeated isotonic concentric contractions at 40% of PT, percent body fat (%BF), and a weighted and timed SC task were examined in 41 (age: 32.3 ± 8.2 yrs; %BF: 24.1 ± 7.9%) male career firefighters. Results Faster SC times (74.7 ± 13.4 s) were associated with greater PT and PP, less fatigability, younger age, and lower %BF (r = −0.530–0.629; P ≤ 0.014), but not Steadiness10% or Steadiness50% (P ≥ 0.193). Stepwise regression analyses indicated that PP and Steadiness50% were the strongest predictors of SC time (R2 = 0.442, P < 0.001). However, when age and %BF were included in the model, these variables became the only significant predictors of SC time (R2 = 0.521, P < 0.001) due to age and %BF being collectively associated with all the neuromuscular variables (excluding Steadiness10%). Conclusions Lower extremity neuromuscular function, specifically PP and steadiness, and %BF are important modifiable predictors of firefighter SC performance, which becomes increasingly important in aging firefighters.",

    "abstract": "Anterior load carriage is common in occupational work and daily activities. Our primary purpose was to systematically review previous work concerning the biomechanics of walking with anterior load carriage. A secondary goal was to conduct a meta-analysis on common gait parameters relevant to front load carriage. An electronic database search yielded eight qualified articles. Meta-analyses were performed for four gait variables: stride length, heel contact velocity, required coefficient of friction, double support time. When possible, subgroup analyses by age were conducted. Results suggest that walking with front load carriage may shorten the stride length, particularly among young adults, but has small effects on the other three variables. Findings should be interpreted with caution given the limited number of studies included and small sample size per study. Future work investigating these four variables and others is needed to further our understanding of the impact of front load carriage on gait.",
